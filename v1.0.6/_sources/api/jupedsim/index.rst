.. py:class:: Agent(backing)


   Represents an Agent in the simulation.

   Agent objects are always retrieved from the simulation and never created directly.

   Agents can be accessed with:

   .. code:: python

       # a specific agent
       sim.agent(id)

       # all agents as iterator
       sim.agents()

       # agents in a specific distance to a point as iterator
       sim.agents_in_range(position, distance)

       # agents in a polygon as iterator
       sim.agents_in_polygon(polygon)

   .. note ::
       You need to be aware that currently there are no checks done when setting
       properties on an Agent instance. For example it is possible to set an Agent position
       outside the walkable area of the Simulation resulting in a crash.

   Do not use.

   Generates randomized 2D coordinates based on a desired agent density per
   square meter.

   This function will generate as many 2D coordinates as required to reach the
   desired density. Essentially this function tries to place area * density
   many agents while adhering to the distance_to_polygon and
   distance_to_agents constraints. This function may not always by able to
   generate the requested coordinate because it cannot do so without violating
   the constraints. In this case the function will stop after max_iterations
   and raise an Exception.

   Generates specified number of randomized 2D coordiantes.

   This function will generate the speficied number of 2D coordiantes where
   all coordiantes are inside the specified geometry and generated coordinates
   are constraint by distance_to_agents and distance_to_polygon. This function
   may not always by able to generate the requested coordinate because it

   Generates randomized 2D coordiantes that fill the specified area to a
   percentage of a possible maximum.

   This function will generate 2D coordinates in the specified area. The
   number of positions generated depends on the ability to place aditional
   points. This function may not always by able to generate the requested
   coordinate because it cannot do so without violating the constraints. In
   this case the function will stop after max_iterations and raise an
   Exception.

   Geometry object representing the area agents can move on.

   Gain access to the simulation's walkable area by calling:

   .. code :: python

.. py:class:: JourneyDescription(stage_ids: Optional[list[int]] = None)


   Used to describe a journey for construction by the :class:`~jupedsim.simulation.Simulation`.

   A Journey describes the desired stations an agent should take when moving through
   the simulation space. A journey is described by a graph of stages (nodes) and
   transitions (edges). See :class:`~jupedsim.journey.Transition` for an overview of the possible
   transitions.

   Create a Journey Description.

   :param stage_ids: list of stages this journey should contain.

   .. py:method:: add(stages: int | list[int]) -> None

   .. py:method:: set_transition_for_stage(stage_id: int, transition: Transition) -> None

      Set a new transition for the specified stage.

      Any prior set transition for this stage will be removed.

      :param stage_id: id of the stage to set the transition for.
      :param transition: transition to set



.. py:class:: Transition(backing)


   Describes the Transition at a stage.

   This type describes how a agent will proceed after completing its stage.
   This effectively describes the set of outbound edges for a stage.

   There are 3 types of transitions currently available:

   * **Fixed transitions:** On completion of this transitions stage all agents
     will proceed to the specified next stage.

   * **Round robin transitions:** On completion of this transitions stage agents
     will proceed in a weighted round-robin manner. A round-robin transitions
     with 3 outgoing stages and the weights 5, 7, 11 the first 5 agents to make
     a choice will take the first stage, the next 7 the second stage and the
     next 11 the third stage. Next 5 will take the first stage, and so on...

   * **Least targeted transition:** On completion of this stage agents will
     proceed towards the currently least targeted amongst the specified choices.
     The number of "targeting" agents is the amount of agents currently moving
     towards this stage. This includes agents from different journeys.

   .. py:method:: create_fixed_transition(stage_id: int) -> Transition
      :staticmethod:

      Create a fixed transition.

      On completion of this transitions stage all agents will proceed to the
      specified next stage.

      :param stage_id: id of the stage to move to next.


   .. py:method:: create_round_robin_transition(stage_weights: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> Transition
      :staticmethod:

      Round-robin transitions: On completion of this transitions stage agents
      will proceed in a weighted round-robin manner. A round-robin
      transitions with 3 outgoing stages and the weights 5, 7, 11 the first 5
      agents to make a choice will take the first stage, the next 7 the
      second stage and the next 11 the third stage. Next 5 will take the
      first stage, and so on...

      :param stage_weights: list of id/weight tuples.


   .. py:method:: create_least_targeted_transition(stage_ids: list[int]) -> Transition
      :staticmethod:

      Create a least targeted transition.

      On completion of this stage agents will proceed towards the currently
      least targeted amongst the specified choices. The number of "targeting"
      agents is the amount of agents currently moving towards this stage.
      This includes agents from different journeys.

      :param stage_ids: list of stage ids to choose the next target from.

   agents move up. If there are more agents trying to enqueue than there are
   waiting positions defined the overflow agents will wait at the last waiting
   position in the queue.

   Similar as with a :class:`NotifiableQueueStage` there needs to be a set of
   waiting positions defined which will be filled in order of definition. The
   :class:`WaitingSetStage` now can be active or inactive. If active agents will fill
   waiting positions until all are occupied. Additional agents will all try to
   wait at the last defined waiting position. In inactive state the
   :class:`WaitingSetStage` acts as a simple waypoint at the position of the first
   defined waiting position.

   .. py:property:: state
      :type: WaitingSetState

      State of the set.

      Can be active or inactive, see :class:`WaitingSetState`

   Example enumeration:

   >>> class Color(Enum):
   ...     RED = 1
   ...     BLUE = 2
   ...     GREEN = 3

   Access them by:

   - attribute access::

   >>> Color.RED
   <Color.RED: 1>

   - value lookup:

   >>> Color(1)
   <Color.RED: 1>

   - name lookup:

   >>> Color['RED']
   <Color.RED: 1>

   Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

   >>> len(Color)
   3

   >>> list(Color)
   [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

   Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
   attributes -- see the documentation for details.
