.. py:class:: Agent(backing)

   Represents an Agent in the simulation.

   Agent objects are always retrieved from the simulation and never created directly.

   Agents can be accessed with:

   .. code:: python

       # a specific agent
       sim.agent(id)

       # all agents as iterator
       sim.agents()

       # agents in a specific distance to a point as iterator
       sim.agents_in_range(position, distance)

       # agents in a polygon as iterator
       sim.agents_in_polygon(polygon)

   .. note ::

       You need to be aware that currently there are no checks done when setting
       properties on an Agent instance. For example it is possible to set an Agent position
       outside the walkable area of the Simulation resulting in a crash.


   .. py:property:: id
      :type: int


      Numeric id of the agent in this simulation.


   .. py:property:: journey_id
      :type: int


      Id of the :class:`~jupedsim.journey.JourneyDescription` the agent is currently following.


   .. py:property:: model
      :type: jupedsim.models.generalized_centrifugal_force.GeneralizedCentrifugalForceModelState | jupedsim.models.collision_free_speed.CollisionFreeSpeedModelState | jupedsim.models.collision_free_speed_v2.CollisionFreeSpeedModelV2State | jupedsim.models.anticipation_velocity_model.AnticipationVelocityModelState | jupedsim.models.social_force.SocialForceModelState


      Access model specific state of this agent.


   .. py:property:: orientation
      :type: tuple[float, float]


      Orientation of the agent.


   .. py:property:: position
      :type: tuple[float, float]


      Position of the agent.


   .. py:property:: stage_id
      :type: int


      Id of the :class:`Stage` the Agent is currently targeting.


   .. py:property:: target
      :type: tuple[float, float]


      Current target of the agent.

      Can be used to directly steer an agent towards the given coordinate.
      This will bypass the strategical and tactical level, but the operational level
      will still be active.

      .. important::

          If the agent is not in a Journey with a DirectSteering stage, any change will be
          ignored.

      .. important::

          When setting the target, the given coordinates must lie within the walkable area.
          Otherwise, an error will be thrown at the next iteration call.

      :returns: Current target of the agent.


.. py:class:: AnticipationVelocityModel

   Anticipation Velocity Model (AVM).

   The AVM incorporates pedestrian anticipation, divided into three phases:
   1. Perception of the current situation.
   2. Prediction of future situations.
   3. Strategy selection leading to action.

   This model quantitatively reproduces bidirectional pedestrian flow by accounting for:
   - Anticipation of changes in neighboring pedestrians' positions.
   - The strategy of following others' movement. The AVM is a model that takes into consideration
     the anticipation of pedestrians. For this, the process of anticipation is divided into three parts:
     - perception of the actual situation,
     - prediction of a future situation and
     - selection of a strategy leading to action.


   A general description of the AVM can be found in the originating publication
   https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103464

   .. attribute:: pushout_strength

      The pushout mechanism ensures agents maintain a safe distance

   .. attribute:: from walls by adding a small outward component to their movement when within the

      

   .. attribute:: critical wall distance. This outward component, scaled by `pushoutStrength`,

      

   .. attribute:: combines with the parallel component of the agent's direction to create smooth,

      

   .. attribute:: gliding behavior along walls.

      

   .. attribute:: rng_seed

      seed value of internally used rng. If not explicitly set this
      value will be chosen randomly.

.. py:class:: Transition(backing)

   Describes the Transition at a stage.

   This type describes how a agent will proceed after completing its stage.
   This effectively describes the set of outbound edges for a stage.

   There are 3 types of transitions currently available:

   * **Fixed transitions:** On completion of this transitions stage all agents
     will proceed to the specified next stage.

   * **Round robin transitions:** On completion of this transitions stage agents
     will proceed in a weighted round-robin manner. A round-robin transitions
     with 3 outgoing stages and the weights 5, 7, 11 the first 5 agents to make
     a choice will take the first stage, the next 7 the second stage and the
     next 11 the third stage. Next 5 will take the first stage, and so on...

   * **Least targeted transition:** On completion of this stage agents will
     proceed towards the currently least targeted amongst the specified choices.
     The number of "targeting" agents is the amount of agents currently moving
     towards this stage. This includes agents from different journeys.


   .. py:method:: create_fixed_transition(stage_id: int) -> Transition
      :staticmethod:


      Create a fixed transition.

      On completion of this transitions stage all agents will proceed to the
      specified next stage.

      :param stage_id: id of the stage to move to next.



   .. py:method:: create_least_targeted_transition(stage_ids: list[int]) -> Transition
      :staticmethod:


      Create a least targeted transition.

      On completion of this stage agents will proceed towards the currently
      least targeted amongst the specified choices. The number of "targeting"
      agents is the amount of agents currently moving towards this stage.
      This includes agents from different journeys.

      :param stage_ids: list of stage ids to choose the next target from.



   .. py:method:: create_round_robin_transition(stage_weights: list[tuple[int, int]]) -> Transition
      :staticmethod:

      Round-robin transitions: On completion of this transitions stage agents
      will proceed in a weighted round-robin manner. A round-robin
      transitions with 3 outgoing stages and the weights 5, 7, 11 the first 5
      agents to make a choice will take the first stage, the next 7 the
      second stage and the next 11 the third stage. Next 5 will take the
      first stage, and so on...

      :param stage_weights: list of id/weight tuples.



.. py:class:: WaitingSetStage(backing)

   Models a set of waiting positions that can be activated or deactivated.

   Similar as with a :class:`NotifiableQueueStage` there needs to be a set of
   waiting positions defined which will be filled in order of definition. The
   :class:`WaitingSetStage` now can be active or inactive. If active agents will fill
   waiting positions until all are occupied. Additional agents will all try to
   wait at the last defined waiting position. In inactive state the
   :class:`WaitingSetStage` acts as a simple waypoint at the position of the first
   defined waiting position.


   .. py:method:: count_targeting() -> int

      :returns: Number of agents currently targeting this stage.



   .. py:method:: count_waiting() -> int

      :returns: Number of agents currently waiting at this stage.



   .. py:method:: waiting() -> list[int]

      Access the ids of all waiting agents in order they are waiting.

      :returns: list of waiting agents ordered by their position.



   .. py:property:: state
      :type: WaitingSetState


      State of the set.

      Can be active or inactive, see :class:`WaitingSetState`


.. py:class:: WaitingSetState(*args, **kwds)

   Bases: :py:obj:`enum.Enum`


   Create a collection of name/value pairs.

   Example enumeration:

   >>> class Color(Enum):
   ...     RED = 1
   ...     BLUE = 2
   ...     GREEN = 3

   Access them by:

   - attribute access:

     >>> Color.RED
     <Color.RED: 1>

   - value lookup:

     >>> Color(1)
     <Color.RED: 1>

   - name lookup:

     >>> Color['RED']
     <Color.RED: 1>

   Enumerations can be iterated over, and know how many members they have:

   >>> len(Color)
   3

   >>> list(Color)
   [<Color.RED: 1>, <Color.BLUE: 2>, <Color.GREEN: 3>]

   Methods can be added to enumerations, and members can have their own
   attributes -- see the documentation for details.


   .. py:attribute:: ACTIVE


   .. py:attribute:: INACTIVE


.. py:class:: WaypointStage(backing)

   distance to the waypoint.


   .. py:method:: count_targeting() -> int

      Returns:
      Number of agents currently targeting this stage.
