    "Lane formation is a quantitative phenomenon, that is observed in bidirectional pedestrian flows. It involves pedestrians automatically forming a number of lanes with varying widths, where individuals within each lane move in the same direction. This self-organizing behavior of pedestrians can have a significant impact on overall evacuation time.\n",

    "In their experiment, Feliciani et al observed bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor with two comparative lanes in each flow direction. Thereby, they changed the ratio of both groups of pedestrians Flow ratio is changed by changing each group size while maintaining comparable total flow and density.\n",

See [Xu2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103464), where a simplified collision-free velocity model that anticipates collisions is presented. This updated model diminishes gridlock events and offers a more accurate depiction of pedestrian movements compared to the previous version.\n",
