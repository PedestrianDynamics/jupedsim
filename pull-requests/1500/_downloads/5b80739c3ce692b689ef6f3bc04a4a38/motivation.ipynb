    "## Simulation of a corridor with different motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we model a narrow corridor scenario featuring three distinct groups of agents. Among them, one group exhibits a higher level of motivation compared to the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We employ the collision-free speed model to determine the speed of each agent. This speed is influenced by the desired speed, denoted as $v^0$, the agent's radius $r$, and the slope factor $T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The varying motivation levels among the groups are represented by different $T$ values. The rationale for using $T$ to depict motivation is that highly motivated pedestrians, who are more aggressive in their movements, will quickly occupy any available space between them, correlating to a lower $T$ value. Conversely, less motivated pedestrians maintain a distance based on their walking speed, aligning with a higher $T$ value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accentuate this dynamic, the first group of agents will decelerate a few seconds into the simulation. As a result, we'll notice that the second group, driven by high motivation, will swiftly close distances and overtake the first group as it reduces speed. In contrast, the third group, with average motivation, will decelerate upon nearing the slower agents, without attempting to pass them. \n",

    "We will be using the a corridor 40 meters long and 4 meters wide."
