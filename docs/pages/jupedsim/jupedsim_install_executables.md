{% include note.html content="Tested on Windows 10 and OSX Catalina (10.5)."%}

## OSX

Download the following dmg-files:

- [Installer for simulation](https://fz-juelich.sciebo.de/s/0xCVR1zYXao1YDW)
- [Installer for visualisation](https://fz-juelich.sciebo.de/s/L2M9VR4TdRrmV0c)

### Open jpscore

![OSX: Install jpscore 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/osx/jpscore0.png)


In the `bin` directory, right-click on the binary `jpscore` and open with a Terminal as shown in the following screenshot:

![OSX: Install jpscore 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/osx/jpscore1.png)

This step runs `jpscore` without any input file. This is a workaround to prevent OSX from 
warning about not verified developer. 

![OSX: Install jpscore 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/osx/jpscore3.png)

{%include important.html content="Before starting a simulation make sure to copy the `bin`-directory as well as the directory of jpscore_samples to a directory, where you have write permissions, e.g. Desktop."%}

Finally, run `jpscore` as follows 

```bash
./jpscore jpscore_samples/bottleneck_ini.xml
```

### Open jpsvis

Open the resulting trajectory file with `jpsvis`. The results should look like the following screenshot:
![OSX: jpsvis]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/osx/jpsvis.png)

## Windows

First, Download the following files:

- [Installer for the simulation](https://fz-juelich.sciebo.de/s/D5ZzrpCiGYYyM5I)
- [ZIP-directory for visualisation](https://fz-juelich.sciebo.de/s/1CQ12M7RjXPwefu)

### Install jpscore

Double-click the `JPScore` installer and click on `next` a couple of times.
{%include note.html content="You will have to accept the [license agreement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuPedSim/jpscore/master/LICENSE)."%}
![Windows: Install jpscore 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/jpscore_install1.png)

{%include important.html content="Make sure to add `JPScore` to the PATH as shown in the following screenshot. In case you don't have sufficient rights to change the system path, you will have to call jpscore using its full path."%}

![Windows: Install jpscore 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/jpscore_install2.png)

In the final installation-step, you can install all the components including the sample files. See:
![Windows: Install jpscore 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/jpscore_install3.png)

Finally, complete the installation by clicking on `Finish`.

![Windows: Install jpscore 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/jpscore_install4.png)

### Start a simulation 

{%include important.html content="Before starting a simulation make sure to copy the directory jpscore_samples files to a direction, where you have write permissions, e.g. Desktop."%}

Open `Powershell` in the directory of `jpscore_samples` as shown in the following screenshot:

![Windows: run simulation 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/run_sim1.png)

then run a simulation by giving jpscore an argument (inifile) as follows: 

```bash
jpscore.exe ./bottleneck_ini.xml
```

![Windows: run simulation 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/run_sim2.png)

The output of a successful simulation with the inifile used above should look like the following:

A directory called `results` should be produced in the same directory as the inifile. 

## Visualize results

To visualize the trajectory file produced in the simulation, you can use `jpsvis`.
Please extract the compressed zip-file you downloaded [here](jupedsim_install_executables.html#windows). 

![Windows: jpsvis 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/jpsvis1.png)

In `JPSvis` click on File -> Open file 
and choose the trajectory file you produced previously.
![Windows: jpsvis 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/win/jpsvis2.png)

Finally, the result should look like in the following screenshot
