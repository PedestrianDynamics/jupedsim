The density  $$\langle \rho \rangle_{\Delta x}$$ is defined as the number of
pedestrians divided by the area of the measurement section:

$$\langle \rho \rangle_{\Delta x}=\frac{N}{b_\text{cor}\cdot\Delta x}.$$

The spatial mean velocity is the average of the instantaneous
velocities  $$v_i(t)$$ for all pedestrians in the measurement area at
time  $$t$$:

$$\langle v \rangle_{\Delta x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}{v_i(t)}.$$
