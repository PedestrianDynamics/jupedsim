What is JuPedSim
================

JuPedSim is a Python package with a C++ core to simulate pedestrian dynamics.
This project originally started in 2010 as a C++ based CLI application. However
looking at how this application was used and abused we decided to rewrite
JuPedSim as a Python package. See: :ref:`_history`

.. note::
   If you find refernces to versions < 0.10 you need to be aware that they
   refer to the old CLI application.
