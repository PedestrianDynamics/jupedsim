Possible Improvements for future releases are

- BINARY mode not working! See prepared tests in Polynomial-test.C.

1) introduce CGAL number type traits and remove
	ring_or_field from RPolynomial popping up in
	Extended_homogeneous and Extended_cartesian

2) transfer plane map to Lutz's new HDS/Topological Map
	mainly deferred by MSVC limitations

3) transfer extended kernel traits classes to functor design
	this has deep impact in many algorithmic modules.
