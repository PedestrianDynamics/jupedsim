Debian packages for CGAL 4.1 Beta 1 are now available for i386 and
amd64. To download the packages via apt-get you need to add

  deb http://www.joachim-reichel.de/debian/repository squeeze main
  deb-src http://www.joachim-reichel.de/debian/repository squeeze main

  deb http://www.joachim-reichel.de/debian/repository wheezy main
  deb-src http://www.joachim-reichel.de/debian/repository wheezy main

  deb http://www.joachim-reichel.de/debian/repository sid main
  deb-src http://www.joachim-reichel.de/debian/repository sid main

to /etc/apt/sources.list (you only need the pair of lines corresponding
to the release you are using). The packages are called libcgal10,
libcgal-dev, libcgal-demo, and libcgal-ipelets.

In case you want to download the packages manually, have a look at

For the final 4.1 release, similar packages will be uploaded to the
official Debian repository and/or be available from the CGAL web site.
