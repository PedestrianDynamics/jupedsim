This is what you need to do to create a release:
------------------------------------------------

SVN Release Branch:
-------------------

Before releasing proper, you need to create a branch, and run the internal
release process on this branch for some time.  Experience shows that there
is very few development (on the packages to be released) on the trunk.
So it seems best to branch as late as possible, in order to avoid the pain
of committing things twice during the final stabilization phase.

For branching, you need to :
  - export svncgal=svn+ssh://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/cgal
  - svn cp $svncgal/trunk $svncgal/tags/CGAL-M.m-branch-tag
  - svn cp $svncgal/trunk $svncgal/branches/CGAL-M.m-branch
  - then switch the release building process to that branch, i.e.:
    - do a check out of the branch
    - call create_new_release with the directory of the branch as argument
  - then update the release numbers in trunk/Maintenance/release_building/*
    and reset the version_number file to 0 for trunk.

Releasing:
----------

For the library:

Let <release_dir> be the directory in which you plan to build the release.

      1.  update the main CHANGES file to correspond to this release
      2.  pick the public versions (.zip and .tar.gz) produced by the
          release building script, corresponding to the internal
	  release which you want to bless as public release.
      3.  The .zip file for the code needs to be repackaged for use with
          InstallShield.  Contact the person in charge of Windows support.

For the manuals:

      1.  Check out the package Manual from the SVN server and follow the
          instructions in the INSTALL file
      2.  cd Manual
      3.  install_manual_files ?.?-I-??  (number of latest internal release)
      4.  follow the directions in Manual/README to create the
          manuals (but don't install them yet)
      5.  in the CGAL-M.m directory, create doc_ps, doc_pdf and
          doc_html/installation directories to hold the installation
          doc. Copy the appropriate files from directory
          Manual/CGAL-M.m_doc_tex/installation to these directories.

      6.  For the HTML version in CGAL-M.m/doc_html (NOT in the Manual
          directory), do the following bit of editing:
             remove the navigation links to bibliography, index and title;
             remove the files title.html and manual_index.html, to_html.log.


For the web pages:
      1.  edit the following web pages (at least)
             Web_pages/news.html
             Web_pages/in_progress.html
             Web_pages/download/index.html
             Web_pages/index.html
             Web_pages/releases.html
             Web_pages/platforms.html
           change release number in:
           (edit and use Manual/script/rename_version)
             Manual/web_pages/doc_html/frameset/panel*.html
             Manual/web_pages/doc_html/html_tar.html
             Manual/web_pages/doc_ps/index.html
             Manual/web_pages/doc_pdf/index.html
      2.  update the cgi-bin/cgal_download.pl script to add the new release,
          goes then to /www/pub/cgi-bin/www.cgal.org/

Install everything:
      1.  install the manual (and include files) in
          /www/pub/www.cgal.org/Manual using "make install"
      2.  copy the .tar.gz and .zip files for the library and
          the documentation to /ftp/pub/outgoing/CGAL/
            (can be done with "make pack" for the documentation)
      3.  zip the individual .ps files for the documentation using
          make dest_zip_ps
      4.  install the new web pages, i.e., make a svn commit in Web_pages/,
          and a 'svn up' in /www/pub/www.cgal.org/
      5.  cp cgi-bin/cgal_download.pl /www/pub/cgi-bin/www.cgal.org/
      6.  tag : svn cp $svncgal/branches/CGAL-M.m-branch $svncgal/tags/CGAL-M.m-release

Then finally ...
      7.  announce the release (see announcement directory)
