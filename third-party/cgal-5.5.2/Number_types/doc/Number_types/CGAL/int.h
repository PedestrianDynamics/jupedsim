This header provides all necessary functions so the fundamental types
`int`, `long int`, and `short int` become models of their respective algebraic concepts.

- `int` is a model of `RealEmbeddable` and `EuclideanRing`,
- `long int` is a model of `RealEmbeddable` and `EuclideanRing`
- `short int` is a model of `RealEmbeddable` and `EuclideanRing`

Due to overflow neither of those types is considered as exact.
