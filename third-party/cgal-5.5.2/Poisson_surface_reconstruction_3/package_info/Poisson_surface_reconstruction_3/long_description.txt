Surface Reconstruction from Point Sets

Pierre Alliez, Laurent Saboret, Gael Guennebaud

This CGAL package implements an implicit surface reconstruction method: Poisson Surface Reconstruction. The input is an unorganized point set with oriented normals. The output is either an implicit function (ready for evaluation by any contouring algorithm), or a surface mesh generated by the CGAL surface mesh generator.
