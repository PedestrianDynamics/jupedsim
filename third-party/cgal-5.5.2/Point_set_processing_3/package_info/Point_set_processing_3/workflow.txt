Analysis
- barycenter, len diag of bbox, etc., see centroid() and bounding_box() in PCA component (done)
- average spacing (KNN) (done)
- lfs estimate (pole approach + arbitrary query points using KNN) (pierre)

Processing
- smoothing (via jet-fitting + reprojection) (done)
- outlier removal (to check which one is easy with CGAL components) (done)
- simplify point sets: clustering, random simplification (done)

Normal estimation
- KNN + point-based PCA (done)
- KNN + jet fitting (done)
- Voronoi diagram + poles [Amenta98] (pierre)
- Voronoi diagram + tetrahedral-based PCA [Alliez07] (pierre)

Normal orientation
- MST [Hope92] (done)
- pole-based (frederic?)


In addition:

Concepts
- Algorithms are independent global functions (no concepts)
- Output formats concept to be defined (laurent?)

Demos, examples and tests
- Command line tests (pierre + laurent)
