Implementation of generalized maps.

A generalized map is a mathematical model allowing to represent  an
object in any dimension by describing the subdivision of the object in
vertices, edges, faces, volumes, ... and the  incidence relationships
on them. Generalized maps allow to describe non orientable object,
contrary to combinatorial maps. However, their main interest is their
homogeneity in any dimension which simplify the algorithms.
