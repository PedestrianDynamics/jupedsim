\brief The class `Labeled_mesh_domain_3` implements indexed domains.

This class is a model of concept `MeshDomain_3`.

Any boundary facet is labeled <a,b>, with a<b, where a and b are the
tags of its incident subdomains.
Thus, a boundary facet of the domain is labeled <0,b>, where b!=0.

This class includes a <em>labeling function</em> that provides the index of the subdomain in which any
query point lies. An intersection between a segment and bounding
surfaces is detected when both segment endpoints are associated with different
values of subdomain indices. The intersection is then constructed by bisection.
The bisection stops when the query segment is shorter than an error bound
`e` given by the product of the
length of the diagonal of the bounding box (in world coordinates), or the radius of the bounding sphere, and
a relative error bound passed as argument to the constructor of `Labeled_mesh_domain_3`.

This class has a constructor taking a labeling function. It has also three
static template member functions that act as named constructors:
<ul>
<li>`create_gray_image_mesh_domain()`, to create a domain from a 3D gray image,
<li>`create_labeled_image_mesh_domain()`, to create a domain from a 3D labeled image, and
<li>`create_implicit_mesh_domain()`, to create a domain from an implicit function.
</ul>

\tparam BGT is a geometric traits class that provides
the basic operations to implement
intersection tests and intersection computations
through a bisection method. This parameter must be instantiated
with a model of the concept `BisectionGeometricTraits_3`.

\cgalHeading{Labeling function}

A labeling function `f` must return `0` if the point isn't located in any subdomain. The return type of labeling functions is an integer.

Let `p` be a Point.
<ul>
<li>`f(p)=0` means that `p` is outside domain.</li>
<li>`f(p)=a`, `a!=0` means that `p` is inside subdomain `a`.</li>
</ul>
`CGAL::Implicit_multi_domain_to_labeling_function_wrapper` is a good candidate for this template parameter
if there are several components to mesh.

The function type can be any model of the concept `Callable` compatible with the signature `Subdomain_index(const Point_3&)`: it can be a function, a function object, a lambda expression... that takes a `%Point_3` as argument, and returns a type convertible to `Subdomain_index`.

This constructor uses named parameters (from the <em>Boost Parameter

\cgalHeading{Named Parameters}
- <b>`parameters::function` (mandatory)</b>  the labeling function, compatible with `Labeling_function`.
- <b>`parameters::bounding_object` (mandatory)</b>  the bounding object is either a bounding sphere (of type `Sphere_3`), a bounding box (type `Bbox_3`), or a bounding `Iso_cuboid_3`. It bounds the meshable space.
- <b>`parameters::relative_error_bound` (optional)</b>  the relative error bound used to compute intersection points between the implicit surface and query segments. The
bisection is stopped when the length of the intersected segment is less than the product of `relative_error_bound` by the diameter of the bounding object. Its default value is `FT(1e-3)`.

\brief Construction from an implicit function

This static method is a <em>named constructor</em>. It constructs a domain
whose bounding surface is described implicitly as the zero level set of a
function.  The domain to be discretized is assumed to be the domain where
the function has negative values.

The method takes as argument a bounding sphere which is required to
circumscribe the surface and to have its center inside the domain.

This constructor uses named parameters (from the <em>Boost Parameter
Library</em>). They can be specified in any order.

\cgalHeading{Named Parameters}
<ul>
<li> <b>`parameters::function` (mandatory)</b>  the implicit function,
compatible with the signature `FT(Point_3)`: it takes a point as argument,
and returns a scalar value. That object must be model of `CopyConstructible`.
<li> <b>`parameters::bounding_object` (mandatory)</b> the bounding object is
either a bounding sphere (of type `Sphere_3`), a bounding box (type
`Bbox_3`), or a bounding `Iso_cuboid_3`. It must bounds the surface, and
its center must be inside the domain.
</ul>

/*!
\brief Construction from a 3D gray image

This static method is a <em>named constructor</em>. It constructs a domain
described by a 3D gray image. A 3D gray image is a grid of voxels,
where each voxel is associated with a gray level value.  Unless otherwise specified by the parameter `image_values_to_subdom_indices`, the domain to
be discretized is the union of voxels that lie inside a surface
described by an isolevel value, called \a isovalue. The voxels lying
inside the domain have gray level values that are larger than the
isovalue.

The value of voxels is interpolated to a gray level value at any query point.

This constructor uses named parameters (from the <em>Boost Parameter
Library</em>). They can be specified in any order.

\cgalHeading{Named Parameters}
The parameters are optional unless otherwise specified.
<ul>

<li> <b>`parameters::image` (mandatory)</b> the input 3D image. Must
be a `CGAL::Image_3` object.

<li><b>`parameters::iso_value`</b> the isovalue, inside
  `image`, of the surface describing the boundary of the object to be
  meshed. Its default value is `0`.

<li><b>`parameters::image_values_to_subdom_indices`</b> a function or
  a function object, compatible with the signature
  `Subdomain_index(double)`. This function returns the subdomain index
  corresponding to a pixel value. If this parameter is used, then the
  parameter `iso_value` is ignored.

<li><b>`parameter::value_outside`</b> the value attached to voxels
 outside of the domain to be meshed. It should be lower than
 `iso_value`. Its default value is `0`.

<li><b>`parameter::relative_error_bound`</b> is the relative error
  bound, relative to the diameter of the box of the image. Its default
  value is `FT(1e-3)`.  </ul>

\brief Construction from a 3D labeled image

This static method is a <em>named constructor</em>. It constructs a
domain described by a 3D labeled image. A 3D labeled image is a grid
of voxels, where each voxel is associated with an index (a subdomain
index) characterizing the subdomain in which the voxel lies. The
domain to be discretized is the union of voxels that have non-zero
values.

This constructor uses named parameters (from the <em>Boost Parameter
Library</em>). They can be specified in any order.

\cgalHeading{Named Parameters}
The parameters are optional unless otherwise specified.
<ul>

<li> <b>`parameters::image` (mandatory)</b> the input 3D image. Must
be a `CGAL::Image_3` object.

<li> <b>`parameters::weights`</b> an input 3D image that provides
weights associated to each voxel (the word type is `unsigned char`,
and the voxels values are integers between 0 and 255).
The weights image can be generated with `CGAL::Mesh_3::generate_label_weights()`.
Its dimensions must be the same as the dimensions of `parameters::image`.

<li><b>`parameter::value_outside`</b> the value attached to voxels
 outside of the domain to be meshed. Its default value is `0`.

<li><b>`parameter::relative_error_bound`</b> is the relative error
  bound, relative to the diameter of the box of the image. Its default
  value is `FT(1e-3)`.  </ul>
