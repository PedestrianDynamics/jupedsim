\ingroup PkgMesh3MeshClasses

The class `Compact_mesh_cell_base_3<Gt, MD>` is a model of the concept `MeshCellBase_3`.
It is designed to serve as cell base class for the 3D triangulation
used in the 3D mesh generation process. It is more compact in memory than
`Mesh_cell_base_3`.

\tparam Gt is the geometric traits class.
It has to be a model of the concept `MeshTriangulationTraits_3`.

\tparam MD provides the types of indices used to identify
the faces of the input complex. It has to be a model
of the concept `MeshDomain_3`.

\tparam Tds is the triangulation data structure class to which cells
belong. That parameter is only used by the rebind mechanism (see
`::TriangulationDSCellBase_3::Rebind_TDS`). Users should always use the
default parameter value `void`.
