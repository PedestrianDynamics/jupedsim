\ingroup PkgMesh3MeshClasses

The class `Mesh_vertex_base_3` is a model of the concept `MeshVertexBase_3`.
It is designed to serve as vertex base class for the 3D triangulation
used in a 3D mesh generation process.

\tparam Gt is the geometric traits class.
It must be a model of the concept `MeshTriangulationTraits_3`.

\tparam MD provides the types of indices
used to identify
the faces of the input complex. It must be a model
of the concept `MeshDomain_3`.

\tparam Vb is the vertex base class. It has to be a model
of the concept `RegularTriangulationVertexBase_3` and defaults to
`Regular_triangulation_vertex_base_3<Gt>`.
