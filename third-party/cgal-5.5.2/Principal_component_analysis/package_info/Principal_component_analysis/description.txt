Package Principal Component Analysis
- provides functions for linear fitting (in the least squares sense)
  of sets of 2D and 3D kernel objects.
- some basic shape analysis functions :
  bounding_box() for point sets.
  centroid() for sets of 2D and 3D kernel objects.
  barycenter() only for sets of weighted points.
