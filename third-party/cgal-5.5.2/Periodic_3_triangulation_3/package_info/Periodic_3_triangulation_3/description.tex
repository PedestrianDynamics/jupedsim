Package Periodic_3_triangulation_3:

This package allows to build and handle triangulations of point sets
in the three dimensional flat torus. Triangulations are built
incrementally and can be modified by insertion or removal of
vertices. They offer point location facilities.

The package provides Delaunay triangulations and offers nearest
neighbor queries and primitives to build the dual Voronoi diagrams.

The package depends on the packages Triangulation_3 and
Triangulation_data_structure_3.
