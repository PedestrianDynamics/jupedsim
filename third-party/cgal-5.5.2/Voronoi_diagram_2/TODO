* remove all predicates methods from halfedge, except has_source and has_target
  these should be renamed to has_finite_source and has_finite_target
* a ccb circulator should also go through the infinite edges
* introduce iterators for infinite items as well (maybe within the accessor)
* introduce is_infinite methods within the class
* implement/document the accessor
