The core module for performing simulations. See the [online documentation](http://jupedsim.org/jpscore/)


## Building from source

### Linux / macOS
The build is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with gcc-9.1 / clang-8 and on macOS Mojave
10.14.5 with dependencies from Homebrew and Apple LLVM 10.

#### Requirements
On Linux you will need a C++17 capable compiler and a standard library that
supports `<filesystem>`. On macOS you will need the system compiler with C++17
and filesystem from boost.

Required:
* boost (>= 1.65)
* libomp (if you want to use OpenMP with Apple LLVm or Clang on Linux)
* spdlog (libspdlog-dev on Ubuntu, spdlog on brew)
* fmtlib (libfmt-dev on Ubuntu, fmt on brew)
* cmake (>= 3.1)

Recommended:
* ninja-build

#### How to build
Once you have installed all dependencies and cloned the repository continue
with a ninja based build:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <path-to-cmakelists>
ninja
```

Alternatively you can generate a make based build with:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug <path-to-cmakelists>
make -j$(nproc)
```
Note: If you do not want to use OpenMP you have to pass `-DUSE_OPENMP=OFF` to
cmake on generation.
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DUSE_OPENMP=OFF <path-to-cmakelists>
```

The following configuration flags are available:

##### USE_OPENMP defaults to ON (Disabled on Windows)
Build `jpscore` with OpenMP support, generation will fail if OpenMP cannot be
found.
MSVC only support OpenMP 2.0 Standard and is therefor disabled on Windows.

##### JPSFIRE defaults to OFF
Build `jpscore` with jpsfire features

##### BUILD_DOC defaults to OFF
Build internal Doxygen based documentation

##### BUILD_CPPUNIT_TEST defaults to OFF
Build unit tests and add them to ctest

##### BUILD_TESTING defaults to OFF
Build full system tests and add them to ctest

##### BUILD_WITH_ASAN defaults to OFF (Does not support Windows)
Build an additional target `jpscore_asan` with address and undefined behavior
sanitizer enabled. Note there is an approx. 2x slowdown when using
`jpscore_asan` over `jpscore`
