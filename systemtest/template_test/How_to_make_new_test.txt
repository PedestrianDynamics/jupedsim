* Adding new Benchmark tests for JPScore
1. find out the number of the last existing test. For example test_100 (i.e. n=100)
2. copy the directory test_1 into a directory with the name test_{n+1} (in this example test_101) 
3. rename the file runtest_1.py into runtest_101.py (101 beeing the number of the test as in point 2.)
4. Adapt the new script, especially by changing the old testnumber 1 to the new test number (in this example 101)
   writing some smart tests.
5. git add your directory test_101. The test will automaticaly be considered for the next nightly build. 

Note: the geometry file should always be called "geometry.xml". The geometry location in the master_ini.xml file is then     <file location="../geometry.xml" />

Let's see if JPScore can pass it.. ;-)
