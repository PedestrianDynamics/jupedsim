    This method compares the configured traffic constraints (e.g. max_agents and outflow) against the actual flow and data.
    For this, the number of agents passing the door in a certain timeperiod is computed.
    The computed number is compared with the expected flow and maximum agents.
    This is done using an allowed error since the simulation might exceed the flow as well as the maximum agents.
    It is possible, that more then one agent crosses the door in a single
