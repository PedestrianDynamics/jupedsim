\section*{Test 1 Maintaining the specified walking speed in a corridor}
It is to be proven that a person in a 2 m wide and 40 m  long  corridor  with  a  defined  walking  speed  will cover  the  distance  in  the  corresponding  time  period.

\noindent
If 40 cm $(body dimension)$ 1 second $(premovement time)$ and 5 \% $(walking speed)$ are set as imprecise values, then the following requirement results with a typical pedestrian speed of 1.33 m/sec: the speed should be set at a value between 4.5 and 5.1 km/h. The travel time should lie in the range of 26 to 34 seconds when 1.33 m/sec is set as the speed.
