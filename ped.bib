  Abstract                 = {Starting with a short review of the available literature in the field of pedestrian and evacuation research, an overview is given over the observed collective phenomena in pedestrian crowds. This includes lane formation in corridors and oscillations at bottlenecks in normal situations, while different kinds of blocked states are produced in panic situations. By means of molecular-dynamic-like microsimulations based on a generalized force model of interactive pedestrian dynamics, the spatio-temporal patterns in pedestrian crowds are successfully reproduced and interpreted
as self-organized phenomena. In contrast to previous socio-psychological approaches, this allows a physical understanding of the observations. Despite the signifcantly different phenomena occuring in normal and panic situations, the main effects can be described by a unified model containing only well interpretable and plausible terms. The transition between the ''rational'' normal behavior and the apparently ''irrational'' panic behavior is controlled by a single parameter, the ''nervousness'', which infuences fluctuation strengths, desired speeds, and the tendency of herding. Thereby,it causes paradoxial effects like ''freezing by heating'', ''faster is slower'',and the ignorance of available exits. Nevertheless, there are measures to improve pedestrian flows, both in normal and panic situations. For example, the suitable placement of columns can help, although they reduce the accessible space.},

  Abstract                 = {Quadtrees and linear quadtrees are well-known hierarchical data structures to represent square images of size 2r times 2r. Finding the neighbors of a specific leaf node is a fundamental operation for many algorithms that manipulate quadtree data structures. In quadtrees, finding neighbors takes O(r) computational time for the worst case, where r is the resolution (or height) of a given quadtree. Schrack [1] proposed a constant-time algorithm for finding equal-sized neighbors in linear quadtrees. His algorithm calculates the location codes of equal-sized neighbors; it says nothing, however, about their existence. To ensure their existence, additional checking of the location codes is needed, which usually takes O(r) computational time. In this paper, a new algorithm to find the neighbors of a given leaf node in a quadtree is proposed which requires just O(1) (i.e., constant) computational time for the worst case. Moreover, the algorithm takes no notice of the existence or nonexistence of neighbors. Thus, no additional checking is needed. The new algorithm will greatly reduce the computational complexities of almost all algorithms based on quadtrees.},

behavior and movement. It appears that the theory of pedestrian traffic flow. for orderly movement under
normal conditions, has been sufficiently developed to reflect the actual behavior of foot traffic flows in
such context, and thus can be adopted for design and control purposes. On the other hand, the review
reveals that virtually no scientific basis appears to be available in the literature to design and analyze
strategies for the management of very large crowds associated with special events. 111e review of relevant
Hajj studie:) shows that very limited research has been directed at crowd behavior and movement during
the Hajj. Modelling capabilities are needed there to help better understand this unique phenomena, and
thus prevent the occurrence of more crowding tragedies. The challenge for any future research, then, is
to develop useful and accurate means for predictingnormai crowd behavior, and for enabling facility m;Jnagers
and designers to evaluate various scenarios before costly mistakes are made.},

The model consists of a set of partial differential equations that are solved numerically following a discretization of time and space. Mathematical relations are defined for three fundamental processes: (a) radial movement, (b) lateral movement, and (c) stoning process. These relations are developed and calibrated using actual measurements taken at the site. As a result, a bidirectional speed-concentration model is developed to describe radial movement, revealing that the impedance to movement from facility users going in the same direction is about twice that from those going in the opposite direction. The overall model is applied to the evaluation of possible design and control strategies aimed at improving the efficiency and throughput of the system.},

Three pedestrian age groups are defined: middle-age, pupils and elderly. A previous developed methodology for modeling pedestrian flows at signalized crosswalks is utilized to generate the fundamental diagrams of pedestrian flow. It is found that the maximum reduction in capacity occurs at roughly equal pedestrian flows from both sides of the crosswalk. Further, it is concluded that elderly pedestrians might cause a significant reduction in capacity up to 30%. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. },

and food processing. We examine granular flow across a bottleneck and find that contrary to
expectations, the flow rate of particulate materials across a bottleneck actually increases if an
optimized obstacle is placed before it. The dependency of flow rate on obstacle diameter is derived
using a phenomenological velocity-density relationship, which peaks at a critical, finite density. This
relationship is in stark contrast to previous models of traffic flow where the velocity-density relation
is monotonically decreasing.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis deals with the representation of the self-developed Necessary-Deceleration- Model (NDM). After mathematical description and derivation, the limits and possibilities of the model are discussed. The NDM is compared with other existing vehicle-following models. After proper calibration the NDM can model largely realistic collision-free driving in all longitudinal traffic situations (free travel, following another vehicle, approaching an obstruction). Furthermore, the model can be classified as reasonable, because the modeled driving behavior responds only slightly to changes in the model parameters. These para- meters that reflect each one characteristic of the driver or the vehicle, are calibrated by means of empirical data from the bycicle-experiments executed on May 6th, 2012. The model shows good agreement with the empirical data especially in the acceleration- and breaking performance of the vehicles. The similarities of the fundamental diagrams of the simulation and the experiment in relevant characteristics confirm that the traffic behavi- or when following another vehicle by the NDM is also realistically. On the basis of the comparison of the trajectories of the experiments and the trajectories of the simulation it turns out that the following behavior emerging from the NDM is in each case realistic.},

We calculate the exact stationary distribution of the periodic system and for a particular line in the phase diagram of the system with open boundaries where particles can enter and leave the system. For repulsive interactions the dynamics can be interpreted as a two-speed model for traffic flow. The exact stationary distribution of the periodic continuous-time system turns out to coincide with that of the asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP) with discrete-time parallel update. However, unlike in the (single-speed) ASEP, the exact flow diagram for the two-speed model resembles in some important features the flow diagram of real traffic. The stationary phase diagram of the open system obtained from Monte Carlo simulations can be understood in terms of a shock moving through the system and an overfeeding effect at the boundaries, thus confirming theoretical predictions of a recently developed general theory of boundary-induced phase transitions. In the case of attractive interaction we observe an unexpected reentrance transition due to boundary effects.},

We develop a model predicting where the next step of a walking pedestrian will be, at a given point in time. The use of the discrete choice framework is justified by its flexibility, the capacity to deal with individuals and the compatibility with agent-based simulation. The model is calibrated using data from actual pedestrian movements, manually taken from video sequences. We present two different formulations: a cross-nested logit and a mixed nested logit. In order to verify the quality of the calibrated model, we have designed and developed a pedestrians simulator.},

  Abstract                 = {The “Traffic and Granular Flow ’07” conference was the seventh of a series
of international conferences that started in 1995 in J¨ulich (Germany). Since
then, the conference took place in Duisburg (1997), Stuttgart (1999), Nagoya
(2001), Delft (2003) and Berlin (2005).
The aim of TGF conferences is to facilitate the exchanges between various
fields dealing with transport. When the conference was created, the fields that
were represented were road traffic and granular flow – hence the name of the
series. Since then, the scope of the conference has been enlarged to include
in particular collective motion in biology (molecular motors), a subject which
turns out to have many connections with the two original ones.
Transversal themes have emerged. For TGF07, a session was specifically
devoted to the subject of networks. An important theme is also the one of
self-propelled particles. It ranges from granular flows with anisotropic grains,
to collective motion of animals, and to pedestrian traffic.
We were very happy to organize the 2007 occurrence of TGF in Orsay
(France), at the University Paris-Sud. The conference was organized mainly
by the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics (LPT), with the help of the Laboratory
FAST (Fluides, Automatique et Syst`emes Thermiques) – these two laboratories
are both associated to the CNRS (Centre National pour la Recherche
Scientifique) – and of the GARIG Group at INRETS.
With more than 2000 researchers or teaching researchers, University Paris-
Sud represents 4% of the french public research. More than 25000 students are
studying at this university. It is known for its high scientific level. Recently, the
Fields medal (2006) honored Wendelin Werner, professor at the mathematical
departement at the Orsay campus. In 2007, the physics Nobel price was given
to A. Fert, professor at University Paris-Sud.
Besides, the Orsay campus is located in a scientifically very active area,
very near for example Ecole Polytechnique and CEA.
In France, research on road traffic is mainly performed in specialized public
research centers, the main two being INRETS (Institut National de Recherche
sur les Transports et leur S´ecurit´e) and LCPC (Laboratoire Central des Ponts 
et Chauss´ees). Both of them have important research centers in region Ilede-
France. Besides, for the sake of building roads, LCPC also has an active
research activity in the granular field.
The TGF07 conference was the opportunity to gather national actors as
well as international researchers. It took place from the 20th to 22nd of June
2007. 127 participants from 24 nationalities were present. The 8 plenary talks
and the 70 posters allowed exchanges between the various communities. Parallel
sessions (48 oral presentations) allowed more specialized and thorough
discussions within each field.
We would like to thank our sponsors. We are especially grateful to Region
Ile-de-France, first because it was our main sponsor, but also because it was
the only one who gave us an answer enough in advance, so that we could
decide to go on. Without Region Ile-de-France, this conference would not have
taken place. The conference was supported also by the CEA (Commissariat
`a l’´energie atomique), the ministry of research, the RTRA “triangle de la
physique”, CNRS, INRETS, DGA, University Paris-Sud, the French embassy
in India, and the European Physical Journal.
We would like to thank Olivier Dauchot and C´ecile Sykes for their valuable
help on scientific and pratical issues, and Henk Hilhorst, the director of the
Laboratory of Theoretical Physics, for his support during the preparation of
the conference. Odile Heckenauer and Mireille Calvet deserve a special thankyou
for all the administrative and organizational work they did before the
conference, and for their presence during the whole conference at the welcome
desk. Thank-you also to G´erard Hoffeurt, Manuel Ramos, Antoine Seguin and
Yann Bertho for their help before and during the conference. We are grateful
to Mrs. Dahm-Courths for the great work she did on the proceedings.},

While the case of periodic boundary conditions was studied in a companion paper, we consider here open boundaries through which particles enter and exit at random times. The full phase diagram is predicted analytically and exhibits a transition between a free flow phase and a jammed phase. The density profile is predicted within the framework of a domain wall theory and compared to Monte Carlo simulations, in particular in the vicinity of the transition. We discuss the relevance of the algorithm for real pedestrian traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {The exclusive queuing process (EQP) incorporates the exclusion
principle into classic queuing models. It is characterized by, in addition to the
entrance probability α and exit probability β, a third parameter: the hopping
probability p. The EQP can be interpreted as an exclusion process of variable
system length. Its phase diagram in the parameter space (α, β) is divided into a
convergent phase and a divergent phase by a critical line which consists of a curved
part and a straight part. Here we extend previous studies of this phase diagram.
We identify subphases in the divergent phase, which can be distinguished by

system length growth. This is done for EQPs with different update rules (parallel,
backward sequential and continuous time). We also investigate the dynamics of
the system length and the number of customers on the critical line. They are
diffusive or subdiffusive with non-universal exponents that also depend on the
update rules.},

Recently, several pedestrian models have been proposed to evaluate pedestrian flow in crowded situations for the purpose of designing facilities. However, current pedestrian simulation models do not explain the negotiation process of collision avoidance between pedestrians, which can be important for representing pedestrian behaviour in congested situations. This study builds a microscopic model of pedestrian behaviour using a two-player game and assuming that pedestrians anticipate movements of other pedestrians so as to avoid colliding with them. A macroscopic tactical model is also proposed to determine a macroscopic path to a given destination. The results of the simulation model are compared with experimental data and observed data in a railway station. Several characteristics of pedestrian flows such as traffic volume and travel time in multidirectional flows, temporal-spatial collision avoidance behaviour and density distribution in the railway station are reproduced in the simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a framework of a dynamic pedestrian model integrated with a strategic route choice model and multi-directional flow propagation. Despite a vast number of proposed pedestrian models especially in the last decade, very few of these considered both pedestrian’s route choice behavior and physical movement in a single integrated framework. In an open space, even after the discretization of the space, a massive number of possible paths for pedestrians can possibly be defined. However, psychologically we obviously do not consider all these paths as distinct options. Thus, pedestrians in this model are assumed to choose a series of consecutive sub-areas to traverse along at first instance. Then, the model allocates the actual flows on each detailed route based up on an assumption of dynamic user optimum (DUO). Combining these two stages of flow allocation, the model thus assumes a hierarchical decision of pedestrian’s route choice. In this paper, a modified cell-transmission model (CTM) is adopted to represent the physical phenomena of congestion and dynamical propagation of pedestrian flows. A key difference to the original CTM is that the pedestrian flow is multi-directional by its nature. Thus, the paper proposes an approach to extend the analysis in the original CTM to consider the multi-directional movement. The paper also illustrates the plausibility of the proposed modified CTM by testing with a test case.},

In this paper, we focus on the fundamental diagram, and on the relation between the instantaneous velocity and spatial headway (distance to the predecessor). While the latter was found to be linear in previous experiments, we show that it is rather a piecewise linear behavior which is found if larger density ranges are covered. Indeed, our data clearly exhibits three distinct regimes in the behavior of pedestrians that follow each other. The transitions between these regimes occur at spatial headways of about 1.1 and 3 m, respectively. This finding could be useful for future modeling.},

We develop a model predicting where the next step of a walking pedestrian will be, at a given point in time. The use of the discrete choice framework is justified by its flexibility, the capacity to deal with individuals and the compatibility with agent-based simulation. The model is calibrated using data from actual pedestrian movements, manually taken from video sequences. We present two different formulations: a cross-nested logit and a mixed nested logit.

The key feature of our approach is that although positions and velocities are continuous, forces do not need to be calculated. This has the advantage that it allows using a larger time step than in force-based models. The room evacuation problem and circular racetrack simulations quantitatively reproduce the available experimental data, both for the specific flow rate and for the fundamental diagram of pedestrian traffic with an outstanding performance. In this last case, the variation of two free parameters (rmin and rmax) of the model accounts for the great variety of experimental fundamental diagrams reported in the literature. Moreover, this variety can be interpreted in terms of these model parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The organized flight of birds is one of the most easily observed, yet challenging to study, phenomena in biology. Birds that fly in organized groups generally do so in one of two fashions: Line formations and Cluster formations. The former groups are typical of large birds such as waterfowl, where birds fly arranged in single lines, often joined together. The scientific questions about these groups usually involve potential adaptive functions, such as why geese fly in a V. Cluster formations are typically made up of large numbers of smaller birds such as pigeons or starlings flying in more irregular arrangements that have a strong three-dimensional character. The groups are defined by synchronized and apparently simultaneous rapid changes in direction. Scientific questions about these groups are usually concerned with mechanism such as how synchrony is achieved. Although field observations about the phenomenon date to the origins of natural history, experimental studies did not begin until the 1970s. Early experimenters and theoreticians were primarily biologists, but more recently aeronautical engineers, mathematicians, computer scientists and, currently, physicists have been attracted to the study of organized flight. Computer modelling has recently generated striking visual representations of organized flight and a number of hypotheses about its functions and mechanisms, but the ability to test these hypotheses lags behind the capacity to generate them. We suggest that a multi disciplinary approach to the phenomenon will be necessary to resolve apparently conflicting current hypotheses. },

By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

Pedestrian crowd models are valuable tools to gain insight into the behavior of human crowds in both, everyday and crisis situations. The main contribution of this work is the definition of a pedestrian crowd model by applying ideas from the field of the kinetic theory of living systems on the one hand, and ideas from the field of computational agents on the other hand. Such combination supported a quantitative characterization of the performance of our agents, a neglected issue in agent-based models, through well-known kinetic parameters. Fundamental diagrams of flow and activity are presented for both, groups of homogeneous pedestrians, and groups of heterogeneous pedestrians in terms of their willingness to reach their goals.},

This paper is focused on agent-based simulation and in particular on the regulation function of the environment, which is a crucial factor supporting the enforcement of the required level of realism in the dynamics generated by the simulation system. In particular, the paper shows that the MAS based simulation context provides features that require a peculiar balance between agent autonomy and environment control on the overall system dynamics.},

In contrast to the NaSch model, the VDR model exhibits metastable states and phase separation in a certain density regime. A proper insertion strategy allows us to investigate the whole spectrum of possible system states and the structure of the phase diagram by Monte Carlo simulations. We observe an interesting microscopic structure of the jammed phases, which is different from the one of the NaSch model. For finite systems, the existence of high flow states in a certain parameter regime leads to a special structure of the fundamental diagram measured in the open system. Apart from that, the results are in agreement with an extremal principle for the flow, which has been introduced for models with a unique flow-density relation. Finally, we discuss the application of our findings for a systematic flow optimization. Here some surprising results are obtained, e.g., a restriction of the inflow can lead to an improvement of the total flow through a bottleneck.},

Results showed that Anglo Saxons used the largest zone of personal space, followed by Asians, then Caucasians, and, as expected, Mediterraneans and Latinos used the shortest distance. Where Latinos adopt a face-to-face position, Caucasians tend to orient themselves to the side of the interviewer, which has an impact on interpersonal communication.},

Particularly, the focus is on scaling problems, namely representation and modeling at microscopic, macroscopic, and mesoscopic scales, which, entangled with the complexity issues of living systems, generate multiscale dynamical effects, such as e.g. self-organization. Mathematical struc- tures suitable to approach such multiscale aspects are proposed, along with a forward look at research developments.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a new concept -- the "Reciprocal Velocity Obstacle"-- for real-time multi-agent navigation. We consider the case in which each agent navigates independently without explicit communication with other agents. Our formulation is an extension of the Velocity Obstacle concept [3], which was introduced for navigation among (passively) moving obstacles. Our approach takes into account the reactive behavior of the other agents by implicitly assuming that the other agents make a similar collision-avoidance reasoning. We show that this method guarantees safe and oscillationfree motions for each of the agents. We apply our concept to navigation of hundreds of agents in densely populated environments containing both static and moving obstacles, and we show that real-time and scalable performance is achieved in such challenging scenarios.},

Given the initial positions and the maximum speeds of the moving obstacles, which we assume are disk-shaped, the regions that are possibly not collision-free are disks that grow over time. We present an approach to compute the time-minimal path between two points in the plane that avoids these growing disks. The generated paths are thus guaranteed to be collision-free with respect to the moving obstacles while being executed. We present an algorithm that runs in O(n^3 log n) time (n being the number of obstacles) for the case where the moving obstacles have the same maximum speed, and a fast implementation for the general case that is capable of planning paths amidst many growing disks within milliseconds.},

The solution of the Riemann problem in the presence of phase transitions is obtained through the construction of a Riemann solver, which enables the definition of the solution of the Cauchy problem using wavefront tracking. The free-flow phase is described using a Newell-Daganzo fundamental diagram, which allows for a more tractable definition of phase transition compared to the original Colombo phase transition model. The accuracy of the numerical solution obtained by a modified Godunov scheme is assessed on benchmark scenarios for the different flux functions constructed.},

CA microsimulation has emerged as a tool for simulating traffic flow and modeling transportation networks. Pedestrian flow is inherently more complex than vehicular flow, and simulation models that are used for emulating vehicular traffic are not directly applicable to modeling pedestrian movements. In previous work the authors demonstrated that unidirectional pedestrian flow patterns consistent with well-established fundamental properties could be generated with CA microsimulation. This paper expands upon the previous effort and presents a CA microsimulation model and emergent fundamental flows for a bidirectional pedestrian walkway. Simulation experiments indicate that the basic model is applicable to walkways of various lengths and widths and across different directional shares of pedestrian movements.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the general problem of determining the steady state of stochastic nonequilibrium systems such as those that have been used to model (among other things) biological transport and traffic flow. We begin with a broad overview of this class of driven-diffusive systems--which includes exclusion processes--focusing on interesting physical properties, such as shocks and phase transitions. We then turn our attention specifically to those models for which the exact distribution of microstates in the steady state can be expressed in a matrix-product form. In addition to a gentle introduction to this matrix-product approach, how it works and how it relates to similar constructions that arise in other physical contexts, we present a unified, pedagogical account of the various means by which the statistical mechanical calculations of macroscopic physical quantities are actually performed. We also review a number of more advanced topics, including nonequilibrium free-energy functionals, the classification of exclusion processes involving multiple particle species, existence proofs of a matrix-product state for a given model and more complicated variants of the matrix-product state that allow various types of parallel dynamics to be handled. We conclude with a brief discussion of open problems for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {Nature is rich with examples of the collective motion of animal groups, such as
flocks of birds or shoals of fish. The mechanisms of self-organization resulting in
these spectacular phenomena have received wide attention. Individual-based models
are a popular and promising approach to investigate and explain features of animal
collective motion. The first part of this thesis gradually develops a novel modelling
framework for the collective motion of animals and justifies it by comparison to em-
pirical findings. Key aspects of the model are stochastic asynchronous updates and
sensory zone sampling of individuals. Higher updating frequencies are related to in-
creased levels of perceived threat and reduced amounts of stochastic effects leading
to synchronisation in moving groups. Sensory zone sampling that is biased according
to the distance between individuals provides a possible mechanism for the empirical
finding that animals on average only interact with a fixed number of nearest neigh-
bours.
Many group-living animals show social preferences for relatives, familiar con-
specifics or individuals of similar attributes, such as size. How such preferences could
affect the collective motion of animal groups has been rather unexplored. The second
part of this thesis reviews previous theoretical work that combines the concepts of
social networks and collective motion. Although many of the models reviewed have
not been explored with ecology in mind, they present a current context in which a
biologically relevant theory can be developed. The modelling framework from the
first part is extended to include social connections as preferential reactions between
individuals. This is used to show that the structure of social networks could influ-
ence the cohesion of groups, the spatial position of individuals within groups and the
hierarchical dynamics within such groups.
This thesis aims to contribute possible mechanisms, testable hypotheses and an
informed starting point for future research on how social networks could affect animal
group movement.},

  Abstract                 = {Many collective human activities, including violence, have been shown to exhibit universal patterns. The size distributions of casualties both in whole wars from 1816 to 1980 and terrorist attacks have separately been shown to follow approximate power-law distributions. However, the possibility of universal patterns ranging across wars in the size distribution or timing of within-conflict events has barely been explored. Here we show that the sizes and timing of violent events within different insurgent conflicts exhibit remarkable similarities. We propose a unified model of human insurgency that reproduces these commonalities, and explains conflict-specific variations quantitatively in terms of underlying rules of engagement. Our model treats each insurgent population as an ecology of dynamically evolving, self-organized groups following common decision-making processes. Our model is consistent with several recent hypotheses about modern insurgency is robust to many generalizations, and establishes a quantitative connection between human insurgency, global terrorism and ecology. Its similarity to financial market models provides a surprising link between violent and non-violent forms of human behaviour.},

This paper discusses laboratory experiments at T-junctions: the setup, the extraction of the trajectories of the pedestrians and the analysis of the result- ing data. Such experiments give us the opportunity to selec- tively analyse parameters independent of undesired influ- ences and adjust them to high densities seldom seen in field studies. For the T-junction the density inside the junction has been varied and analysed. Two strategies for the time- efficient automatic extraction of accurate pedestrian trajec- tories from stereo recordings are presented. One strategy uses marker for detection and the other one based on a perspective depth field. From these trajectories the funda- mental diagram of T-junction flow is analysed, the density, velocity and specific flow profiles are obtained using the Voronoi method.},

The most difficult stage in the development and use of such models is the calibration and validation of the microscopic sub-models such as the car following and gap acceptance models. This difficulty is due to the lack of suitable methods for adapting models to empirical data. The aim of this paper is to present recent progress in calibrating a number of microscopic traffic flow models. Ten very different models have been tested using data collected via DGPS-equipped cars (Differential Global Positioning System) on a test track in Japan. To calibrate the models, the data of the leading car are fed into the model under consideration and the model is used to compute the headway time series of the following car. The deviations between the measured and the simulated headways are then used to calibrate and validate the models. The calibration results agree with earlier studies as there are errors of 12 % to 17% for all models and no model can be denoted to be the best. The differences between individual drivers are larger than the differences between different models. The validation process gives acceptable errors from 17 % to 22%. But for special data sets with validation errors up to 60% the calibration process has reached what is known as "overfitting": bec},

There are a large number of available models used in many countries. The important difficult stage in the development and use of such models is the calibration and validation of the microscopic sub-models describing the traffic flow, such as the car following models for example. The aim of this paper is to present recent progress in calibrating more than a dozen microscopic traffic flow models with very different data sets conducted by DGPS-equipped cars (Differential Global Positioning System), loop detectors and human observers. Different approaches to measure the errors the models produce in comparison to reality are compared. It can be stated that from a microscopic point of view errors of about 15-20% in headway- and travel time-estimation and about 2-7% in speed-estimation of individual vehicles in the car following process seem to be the minimal reachable level. Furthermore, the larger the simulation horizon is, the smaller the diversity of the analyzed models become in comparison to the diversity in the driver behaviour. Most interesting, no model cold be denoted to be the best and especially highly sophisticated models did not produce better results than very simple ones.},

The models are oriented to specific real world applications: a one-dimensional model of crowd-structure interaction in footbridges and a two-dimensional model of pedestrian flow in an underground station with several obstacles and exits. The noticeable heterogeneity of the applications demonstrates the signicance of the physical framework and its versatility in addressing different engineering problems. The results of the simulations point out the key role played by the physiological and psychological features of human perception on the overall

One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information.},

z.B. „Empfehlungen für Radverkehrsanlagen –
ERA 95“ der FGSV angegebenen Breiten für Rad-
verkehrsanlagen gehen bei der Festlegung einer
Regelbreite grundsätzlich davon aus, dass bei ein-
spurigem Verkehr auch eine Überholmöglichkeit
gegeben sein soll. Aus Sicherheitsgründen soll zu-
sätzlich ein Trennstreifen zur Fahrbahn oder zum
Parkstreifen eingerichtet werden. Bei mehrspuriger
Radverkehrsführung und bei Zweirichtungsradwe-
gen werden die Breiten durch Addition der Bewe-
gungsräume festgelegt.
Bemessungsverfahren für die Breite von Radver-
kehrsanlagen auf der Strecke zwischen Knoten auf
Basis von Verkehrsmengen sind bisher in Deutsch-
land nicht zur Anwendung gekommen.
Ein Verfahren, das auch Angaben zu Verkehrsqua-
litätsstufen und davon abhängige Radverkehrs-
dichten bzw. zulässige Radverkehrsstärken je
Fahrstreifen einer Radverkehrsanlage definiert,
wird im Entwurf für das „Handbuch zur Bemessung
von Straßen“ (HBS) beschrieben (Brilon/Groß-
mann/Blanke 1994). Dieses Verfahren wurde zum
überwiegenden Teil auf der Basis von nicht empi-
risch ermittelten Daten erarbeitet.
Im Gegensatz zu Autofahrern, deren individuelles
Fahrverhalten durch weitgehend einheitliche tech-
nische Standards in der Masse eher nivelliert wird,
ruft eine breite Palette unterschiedlicher Einfluss-
faktoren ein mehr heterogenes Erscheinungsbild
beim Fahrverhalten der Radfahrer hervor. Dabei
gehören
•
Verkehrszweck
•
Alter
•
Geschlecht
•
Kondition/Konstitution
zu den individuellen Faktoren,
•
Ausrüstung
•
Fahrradtyp und
•
Ausstattung des Fahrrades
zu den technischen Voraussetzungen, die bei den
einzelnen Radfahrern sehr unterschiedlich sein
können. Nimmt man noch die Charakteristika der
Strecken hinzu (Breite, Belag, Neigung, Kurvenra-
dius), lässt sich eine hohe Vielfalt von Untersu-
chungsfällen finden, die aber aufgrund des nur be-
grenzt verfügbaren Ressourceneinsatzes nicht alle
in hinreichender Detailschärfe betrachtet und aus-
gewertet werden können.
Regelwerke mit ähnlich bindendem Charakter wie
die o.g. Richtlinien existieren bislang für den Rad-

  Abstract                 = {The design and dimensioning of escape routes in grandstands influence significantly the whole evacuation process of a football stadium. To analyze pedestrian traffic on grandstands, experiments under laboratory conditions with up to 300 participants have been performed in the ESPRIT arena in Düsseldorf. Fieldstudies in the same stadium and the BORUSSIA-PARK in Mönchengladbach complement the experimental database. In the first part of the dissertation an extensive literature review of pedestrian dynamics on stairs is presented. Precise trajectories, extracted from own experiments, are used to derive the fundamental diagram. The spatial dependency of the basic quantities velocity, density and specific flow on stairs is analyzed. Various influences on the flow and density in the mouth – standing and seated terraces, different slope of the grandstand, positioning of security personnel – are quantified in the second part of the thesis. Based on this data and gained insights the last chapter deals with the validation of a computersimulation. It is clarified, which aspects have to be considered for the validation of a spatial-continuous model. The comparison of the simulation results with experimental data allows conclusions about the correct approximation of reality.},

To analyze the fundamental diagram for stairs, field studies as well as experiments under laboratory conditions were performed at an external staircase of a german football stadium. The results of our measurements are compared with fundamental diagrams from well-known planning handbooks for pedestrian facilities and evacuation routes.
In the guidelines it is not described, how to interpret the given fundamental diagrams. The reference to our results shows, that the published specifications show maximum possible flow and not mean values. Also the comparison of field study and experiments under laboratory conditions at the same location clarifies how important it is to give additional information about performed experiments (e.g. experiment type, participants, measurement method, angle, direction) on which the fundamental diagram is based.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This contribution summarizes information about the fundamental diagram of stairs. First discrepancies of fundamental diagrams of well-known planning handbooks for pedestrian facilities and evacuation routes are discussed. To proof the correspondence to experimental data, published measurements available in literature are collected and compared. In the second part we derive a fundamental diagram for stairs downwards based on precise trajectories. In addition we scrutinize the influence of the slope of stair on the fundamental diagram. To check whether our experiments performed under laboratory conditions are comparable with characteristics of motion of every day situations, we present a comparison with a field study carried out at the same external staircase. Furthermore the contribution shows a method to gain topographical information of density, velocity, and specific flow structures to get a microscopic insight into pedestrian dynamics on stairs. This information could be used to identify effective bottlenecks.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a two-dimensional cellular automaton model to simulate pedestrian traffic. It is a vmax=1 model with exclusion statistics and parallel dynamics. Long-range interactions between the pedestrians are mediated by a so-called floor field which modifies the transition rates to neighbouring cells. This field, which can be discrete or continuous, is subject to diffusion and decay. Furthermore it can be modified by the motion of the pedestrians. Therefore, the model uses an idea similar to chemotaxis, but with pedestrians following a virtual rather than a chemical trace. Our main goal is to show that the introduction of such a floor field is sufficient to model collective effects and self-organization encountered in pedestrian dynamics, e.g. lane formation in counterflow through a large corridor. As an application we also present simulations of the evacuation of a large room with reduced visibility, e.g. due to failure of lights or smoke.},

The model algorithm states that every agents’ motion seeks for an optimal distance from the nearest topological neighbour encompassed in a limited attention field. Despite the great simplicity of the implementation, varying the amplitude of the attention landscape, swarms pass from cohesive and regular structures towards fragmented and irregular configurations. Interestingly, this movement rule is an ideal candidate for implementing the selfish herd hypothesis which explains aggregation of alarmed group of social animals.},

  Abstract                 = {Experiments have been performed to study pedestrian flow through bottlenecks under oversaturated conditions. The data underline a new phenomenon in pedestrian flows: when high-density conditions occur upstream of a bottleneck, the maximum capacity of the bottleneck (i.e. the maximum number of pedestrians that can flow through the bottleneck in a given time interval) can drop. This is referred to as "capacity drop" and should be carefully taken into account when dealing with building evacuation philosophy.

Controlling the population density upstream of a bottleneck can maximise the flow through it (i.e. by avoiding capacity drop) and shorten the building evacuation time significantly. This paper focuses on alarm times and egress routes (in terms of their geometrical characteristics like length, width) as means for controlling population densities and therefore reducing building evacuation time.

Specifically, the proposed methodology includes an optimisation algorithm that explores the research space (defined by all the possible Route-Alarm Time schedule plans where a Route-Alarm Time schedule plan is in turn defined by a set of alarm times and a set of egress routes) and aims to find the Route-Alarm Time schedule plan that minimises the building evacuation time. We call building evacuation time the temporal gap between the time the first person starts to egress the building until all people have reached an area of safety outside the building.

A newly proposed movement model, embedded into the optimisation algorithm, allows the building evacuation time for a given Route-Alarm Time schedule plan to be assessed by simulating the egress dynamics.

This movement model is able to reproduce the capacity drop phenomenon observed in the experimental work and can therefore assess the building evacuation time taking into account the capacities of the various bottlenecks adjusted to take into account the actual upstream densities.

The optimisation algorithm, with the movement model embedded in it, has been implemented in an object-oriented simulator.

The Route-Alarm Time schedule planning refers to a phased evacuation in a static environment where all the egress paths are viable and the pedestrian population is well-trained.},

  Abstract                 = {The phase transition from a free-flow phase to a jammed phase is an important feature of traffic networks. We study this transition in the case of a simple square lattice network for different values of data posting rate (rho) by introducing a parameter p which selects a neighbour for onward data transfer depending on queued traffic. For every rho there is a critical value of p above which the system becomes jammed. The rho-p phase diagram shows some interesting features. We also show that the average load diverges logarithmically as p approaches pc and the queue length distribution exhibits exponential and algebraic nature in different regions of the phase diagram.},

  Abstract                 = {The relation between speed and density is connected with every self-organization phenomenon of pedestrian dynamics and offers the opportunity to analyze them quantitatively. But even for the simplest systems, like pedestrian streams in corridors, this fundamental relation isn't completely understood. Specifications of this characteristic in guidelines and text books differ considerably reflecting the contradictory database and the controversial discussion documented in the literature. In this contribution it is studied whether cultural influences and length of the corridor can be the causes for these deviations. To reduce as much as possible unintentioned effects, a system is chosen with reduced degrees of freedom and thus the most simple system, namely the movement of pedestrians along a line under closed boundary conditions. It is found that the speed of Indian test persons is less dependent on density than the speed of German test persons. Surprisingly the more unordered behaviour of the Indians is more effective than the ordered behaviour of the Germans. Without any statistical measure one cannot conclude about whether there are differences or not. By hypothesis test it is found quantitatively that these differences exist, suggesting cultural differences in the fundamental diagram of pedestrians.},

  Abstract                 = {A force-driving cellular automata model considering the social force on cell movement, such as the desirous willing of a pedestrian to exit, the repulsive interaction among pedestrians or between pedestrians and obstacles, was set up to investigate the evacuation behaviors of pedestrians at a T-shaped intersection. And an analogical formulation, taking reference of the magnetic force, was introduced to describe the above repulsive actions. Based on the model, the evacuation behaviors of pedestrians were simulated in terms of different pedestrian density, distribution and corridor width, and then evacuation time was obtained and analyzed. Furthermore, an experiment was conducted to verify the results of the presented model. The results demonstrate that when the density of pedestrians is greater than a certain threshold, pedestrians of a certain direction would be jammed by the repulsion from pedestrians of the counter flow from another direction, and the evacuation time of the former would be longer, even though they are closer to the exit, which would possibly result in a serious casualty in an emergency circumstance. And the phenomenon has been validated by the experiments well. In addition, a corresponding critical corridor width related to different DOPs, beyond which the evacuation time could be decreased rapidly due to a strong degradation of jamming behaviors near the T-shaped intersection, was also discovered and predicted by the proposed model.},

Given different panic parameter, the density-capacity and density-velocity relations with different gradient of stairs are achieved from the simulation. From the discussion and analysis, it can be concluded that the capacity of a stairs is higher when pedestrian are more motivated to move, and capacity are higher on stairs with a normal gradient than on stairs with a steep gradient.

For different types of facilities, pedestrian traffic may have a longitudinal flow (unidirectional or bidirectional), cross flow, or multidirectional flow.

Confined level passageways, ascending stairways, descending stairways, and two-way stairways in Shanghai, China, Metro stations with massive passenger volumes were observed; and data from those locations were collected. Pedestrian flow parameters, including volume, density, and speed, under comparatively full operation states from low density to high density, were acquired by video recording. Overall trends in the relationships between pedestrian volume, density, and speed were analyzed with scatter plots. With full consideration of the significance of the statistical regression results and consistency with reality, models of pedestrian traffic flow for speed-density and volume-density relationships were
established for all the facilities observed. The characteristics of the built models in combination with walking behavior, determined by comparison
of the differences in the characteristics of walking facilities and traffic operations, are discussed. The collected data, built models, and pedestrian flow characteristics that were revealed could be helpful for improving theories on pedestrian traffic flow and be valuable references to similar studies in the pedestrian context.},

The quickest path problem is to find a routing path in N such that the time required to ship Ïƒ units of data from the source to the sink is minimum. When the value of Ïƒ is given, an O(m2 + nm log m) algorithm is designed to find the quickest path, where m and n are the numbers of arcs and nodes in the network N, respectively. By generalizing this algorithm properly, a more general algorithm with similar time complexity is developed to find quickest paths for all possible values of Ïƒ. Using the algorithm, the values of Ïƒ can be divided into O(m) ordered regions such that each region has a corresponding quickest path; therefore, if the general algorithm is used as a preprocessing step to handle the input network N, then the problem of finding a quickest path for a given value of Ïƒ can be solved in time O(log m). },

  Abstract                 = {Molecular motors are proteins or macromolecular complexes which use input energy to perform mechanical work. Some of these motors move on filamentous proteins whereas other move on DNA or RNA strands. Often, many such motors move simultaneously on the same track and their collective movement is similar to vehicular traffic on highways. We have developed theoretical models of different types of molecular motor traffic by appropriately extending the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). Thus, our models of molecular motor traffic belong to the broad class of driven-diffusive lattice gas models which have close relations with cellular automata. By drawing analogy with vehicular traffic, we have introduced novel quantities for characterizing the nature of the spatio-temporal organization of molecular motors on their tracks. We show how the mechano-chemistry of the individual motors influence the traffic-like intracellular collective phenomena.},

  Abstract                 = {In the so-called ''microscopic'' models of vehicular traffic, attention is paid explicitly to each individual vehicle each of which is represented by a ''particle''; the nature of the ''interactions'' among these particles is determined by the way the vehicles influence each others' movement. Therefore, vehicular traffic, modeled as a system of interacting ''particles'' driven far from equilibrium, offers the possibility to study various fundamental aspects of truly nonequilibrium systems which are of current interest in statistical physics. Analytical as well as numerical techniques of statistical physics are being used to study these models to understand rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by vehicular traffic. Some of these phenomena, observed in vehicular traffic under different circumstances, include transitions from one dynamical phase to another, criticality and self-organized criticality, metastability and hysteresis, phase-segregation, etc. In this critical review, written from the perspective of statistical physics, we explain the guiding principles behind all the main theoretical approaches. But we present detailed discussions on the results obtained mainly from the so-called ''particle-hopping'' models, particularly emphasizing those which have been formulated in recent years using the language of cellular automata.},

  Abstract                 = {New construction must comply with building codes to ensure safety performance. However, the code itself is insufficient to provide information regarding hazard mitigation performance of a facility design. This paper proposes a computer simulation model for selecting the facility design for emergency evacuation that includes a pedestrian model and a selection model. A cellular automaton model of pedestrian movements with three-dimensional visualization is implemented and calibrated. Unlike previous studies that focus on behavior theories and ignore model calibration, this paper calibrates the pedestrian model with empirical data at the macroscopic level (flow, density, and speed). After candidate facility designs are evaluated with the calibrated model, a two-stage procedure is used for the statistical selection of the alternatives. As a result, the best design can be selected with a pre-determined probability of correct selection and targeted difference between the best and the second-best systems. Moreover, the required number of repetitions can be calculated in advance to avoid incorrect selection or unnecessary work. The procedure proposed is, thus, an effective and efficient tool for facility design.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a quantitative risk assessment framework for evaluating fire risk to life safety. Fire risk is divided into two parts: probability and corresponding consequence of every fire scenario. The time-dependent event tree technique is used to analyze probable fire scenarios based on the effect of fire protection systems on fire spread and smoke movement. To obtain the variation of occurrence probability with time, Markov chain is combined with a time-dependent event tree for stochastic analysis on the occurrence probability of fire scenarios. To obtain consequences of every fire scenario, some uncertainties are considered in the risk analysis process. When calculating the onset time to untenable conditions, a range of fires are designed based on different fire growth rates, after which uncertainty of onset time to untenable conditions can be characterized by probability distribution. When calculating occupant evacuation time, occupant premovement time is considered as a probability distribution. Consequences of a fire scenario can be evaluated according to probability distribution of evacuation time and onset time of untenable conditions. Then, fire risk to life safety can be evaluated based on occurrence probability and consequences of every fire scenario. To express the risk assessment method in detail, a commercial building is presented as a case study. A
discussion compares the assessment result of the case study with fire statistics.},

Each flow takes place on a lattice strip of width M so that the intersection is an M × M square. We investigate the spontaneous formation, observed experimentally and in simulations, of a diagonal pattern of stripes in which alternatingly one of the two particle types dominates. By a linear stability analysis of the field equations we show how this pattern formation comes about. We focus on the observation, reported recently, that the striped pattern actually consists of chevrons rather than straight lines. We demonstrate that this ‘chevron effect’ occurs both in particle simulations with various different update schemes and in field simulations. We quantify the effect in terms of the chevron angle Δθ0 and determine its dependency on the parameters governing the boundary conditions.},

We systematically show that the value of the critical loading rate at which congestion emerges is affected by the addition of spatial dynamics, changing the nature of this transition from a continuous to a discontinuous one. Our numerical results are confirmed by introducing an analytical solvable framework. As a case of study, we explore the implications of our findings in the San Francisco road network where we can locate the roads that originate the congested phase. These roads are spatially constrained, and not necessarily those with high betweenness as predicted by models without spatial dynamics.},

Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information.We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems.},

We reveal the existence of major group-level behavioural transitions related to minor changes in individual-level interactions. Further, we present the first evidence for collective memory in such animal groups (where the previous history of group structure influences the collective behaviour exhibited as individual interactions change) during the transition of a group from one type of collective behaviour to another. The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole. These results are considered in the context of the evolution and ecological importance of animal groups. },

  Abstract                 = {Cities worldwide are increasingly becoming agents of climate change mitigation, while simultaneously aiming for other goals, such as improved accessibility and clean air. Based on stakeholder interviews and data analysis, we assess the current state of urban mobility in the four European cities of Barcelona, Malmö, Sofia and Freiburg. We then provide scenarios of increasingly ambitious policy packages, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from urban transport by up to 80% from 2010 to 2040. We find significant concurrent co-benefits in cleaner air, reduced noise ambience, fewer traffic-related injuries and deaths, more physical activity, less congestion and monetary fuel savings. Our scenarios suggest that non-motorized transport, especially bicycles, can occupy high modal shares, particularly in cities with less than 0.5 million inhabitants. We think that this kind of multi-criteria assessment of social costs and benefits is a useful complement to cost–benefit analysis of climate change mitigation measures.},

  Abstract                 = {Agent-based modelling (ABM) is becoming the dominant paradigm in social simulation due primarily to a worldview that suggests that complex systems emerge from the bottom-up, are highly decentralised, and are composed of a multitude of heterogeneous objects called agents. These agents act with some purpose and their interaction, usually through time and space, generates emergent order, often at higher levels than those at which such agents operate. ABM however raises as many challenges as it seeks to resolve.It is the purpose of this paper to catalogue these challenges and to illustrate them using three somewhat different agent-based models applied to city systems. The seven challenges we pose involve: the purpose for which the model is built, the extent to which the model is rooted in independent theory, the extent to which the model can be replicated, the ways the model might be verified, calibrated and validated, the way model dynamics are represented in terms of agent interactions, the extent to which the model is operational, and the way the model can be communicated and shared with others. Once catalogued, we then illustrate these challenges with a pedestrian model for emergency evacuation in central London, a hypothetical model of residential segregation model tuned to London data, and an agent-based residential location model, for Greater London. The ambiguities posed by this new style of modelling are drawn out as conclusions, and the relative arbitrariness of such modelling highlighted.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a system to simulate the movement of individual agents in large-scale crowds performing the Tawaf. The Tawaf serves as a unique test case. The crowd consists of a heterogeneous set of pilgrims, varying with respect to physical capacity as well as activity. Furthermore, the density of the crowd reaches very high levels. Our approach uses a finite state machine to specify the behavior of the agents at each time step in conjunction with a geometric, agent-based algorithm to specify how an agent interacts with its local neighbors to generate collision-free trajectories. The overall system can model agents with varying age, gender and behaviors, supporting the heterogeniety observed in the performance of the Tawaf, even at high densities.},

These models lie at the foundation of all three fields, are studied extensively, and can be highly influential. Yet new computational and mathematical tools may challenge even well-established beliefs. Consider the BML model, which is a paradigm for modeling self-organized patterns of traffic flow and first-order jamming transitions. Recent findings, on the existence of intermediate states, bring into question the standard understanding of the jamming transition. We review the results and show that the onset of full-jamming can be considerably delayed based on the geometry of the system. We also introduce an asynchronous version of
BML, which lacks the self-organizing properties of BML, has none of the puzzling intermediate states, but has a sharp, discontinuous, transition to full jamming.We believe this asynchronous version will be more amenable to rigorous mathematical analysis than standard BML.We discuss additional models, such as bootstrap percolation, the honey-comb dimer model and the rotor-router, all of which exemplify the interplay between the three fields, while also providing cautionary tales. Finally, we synthesize implications for how results from one field may relate to the other, and also implications specific to computer implementations.},

There is no reason to assume that the pedestrian behaviour in the controlled situations differs from their behaviour in practice; moreover, the group is representative for the pedestrian population in a practical situation.
The research offers new insights into the walking behaviour of pedestrians, as is discussed in this contribution. Examples are the way pedestrians use the scarcely available area, choose their speed,
accelerate and decelerate, negotiate with each other, pass each other, etc.},

The average observed capacities are for all widths lowest for the lowest stress level and highest for the highest stress level. The population with a greater part of children has the highest capacity, while the lowest capacity is, as expected, found for the experiment with 5% disabled participants. The presence of a door opened in the escape direction in an angle of 90 degrees for a door opening of 85 cm results in a 20% capacity reduction.},

In an attempt to correct some of these, "higher order" theories have been proposed starting in the early 70s. Unfortunately, the usefulness of these improvements can be questioned. This note describes the logical flaws in the arguments that have been advanced to derive higher order continuum models, and shows that the proposed high order modifications lead to a fundamentally flawed model structure. The modifications can actually make things worse.

As an illustration of this, it is shown that any continuum model of traffic flow that smooths out all discontinuities in density will predict negative flows and negative speeds (i.e., "wrong way travel") under certain conditions. Such unreasonable predictions are made by all existing models formulated as a quasilinear system of partial differential equations in speed, density, and (sometimes) other variables but not by the LWR model.

The note discusses the available empirical evidence and ends with a (hopefully positive) commentary on what can be accomplished with first-order models.},

The strategy is non-anticipative because it does not rely on demand forecasts, adaptive because it uses real-time traffic information, and decentralized because all the information is available locally. It can be used with a failed communication network.
The strategy pertains to networks in which no links backtrack in the direction of increased risk. For these types of networks, no other strategy exists that can evacuate more people in any given time, or finish the evacuation in less time. The strategy is also shown to be socially fair, in the sense that the time needed to evacuate all the people exceeding any risk level is, both, the least possible, and the same as if less-at-risk individuals did not participate in the evacuation. The strategy can be proven optimal even when backflows happen due to driver gaming.},

A key element in the methodology developed to carry out the assessments was PEDROUTE, a computer package which provides estimates of pedestrian flows and delays in congested station networks. In common with urban traffic assignment procedures, PEDROUTE requires as input relationships between flow and travel time for each of the facilities comprising the network. This article reports on the results of a study commissioned by LUL to derive such relationships. It begins with a description of the analytical aspects of the model fitting and then describes the data and results achieved for each of six types of facility, comparing the preferred fits with th existing relationships derived from previous work.},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Building a reliable predictive model of pedestrian motion is very challenging: Ideally, such models should be based on observations made in both controlled experiments and in real-world environments. De facto, models are rarely based on real-world observations due to the lack of available data; instead, they are largely based on intuition and, at best, literature values and laboratory experiments. Such an approach is insufficient for reliable simulations of complex real-life scenarios: For instance, our analysis of pedestrian motion under natural conditions at a major German railway station reveals that the values for free-flow velocities and the flow-density relationship differ significantly from widely used literature values. It is thus necessary to calibrate and validate the model against relevant real-life data to make it capable of reproducing and predicting real-life scenarios. In this work we aim at constructing such realistic pedestrian stream simulation. Based on the analysis of real-life data, we present a methodology that identifies key parameters and interdependencies that enable us to properly calibrate the model. The success of the approach is demonstrated for a benchmark model, a cellular automaton. We show that the proposed approach significantly improves the reliability of the simulation and hence the potential prediction accuracy. The simulation is validated by comparing the local density evolution of the measured data to that of the simulated data. We find that for our model the most sensitive parameters are: the source-target distribution of the pedestrian trajectories, the schedule of pedestrian appearances in the scenario and the mean free-flow velocity. Our results emphasize the need for real-life data extraction and analysis to enable predictive simulations.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {People die or get injured at mass events when the crowd gets out of control. Urbanization and the increasing popularity of mass events, from soccer games to religious celebrations, enforce this trend. Thus, there is a strong need to better control crowd behavior. Here, simulation of pedestrian streams can be very helpful: Simulations allow a user to run through a number of scenarios in a critical situation and thereby to investigate adequate measures to improve security. In order to make realistic, reliable predictions, a model must be able to reproduce the data known from experiments quantitatively. Therefore, automatic and fast calibration methods are needed that can easily adapt model parameters to different scenarios. Also, the model must be robust. Small changes or measurement errors in the crucial input parameters must not lead to disproportionally large changes in the simulation outcome and thus potentially useless results. In this paper we present two methods to automatically calibrate pedestrian simulations to the socio-cultural parameters captured through measured fundamental diagrams. We then introduce a concept of robustness to compare the two methods. In particular, we propose a quantitative estimation of parameter quality and a method of parameter selection based on a criterion for robustness. We discuss the results of our test scenarios and, based on our experience, propose further steps.},

Locomotor control systems combine rapid mechanical preflexes with multimodal sensory feedback and feedforward commands.

There are two major differences: movement in a \{CA\} is restricted to a grid and navigation is achieved by moving directly in the desired direction. Force based \{ODE\} models operate in continuous space and navigation is computed indirectly through the acceleration vector. We present the Optimal Steps Model and the Gradient Navigation Model, which produce trajectories similar to each other. Both are grid-free and free of oscillations, leading to the conclusion that the two major differences are also the two major weaknesses of the older models.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the outline of a multi-agent model that can be used for visualizing simulated user behavior to support the assessment of design performance. We will consider various performance indicators of building environments, which are related to user reaction to design decisions. This system may serve as a media tool in the design process for a better understanding of what the design will look like, especially for those cases where design or planning decisions will affect the behavior of individuals. The system is based on cellular automata and multi-agent simulation technology. The system simulates how agents move around in a particular 3D (or 2D) environment, in which space is represented as a lattice of cells. Agents represent objects or people with their own behavior, moving over the network. Each agent will be located in a simulated space, based on the cellular automata grid. Each iteration of the simulation is based on a parallel update of the agents conforming local rules. Agents positioned within an environment will need sensors to perceive their local neighborhood and some means with which to affect the environment. In this way, autonomous individuals and the interaction between them can be simulated by the system. As a result, designers can use the system to assess the likely consequences of their design decisions on user behavior. We think that the system provides a potentially valuable tool to support design and decision-making processes, related to user behavior in architecture and urban planning.},

  Abstract                 = {Mass events such as the Olympic games or popular entertainment gathering often attract hundreds of thousands of people. If an abrupt event (e.g., fire, bomb threat) prompts people to rush to exits, stampedes may occur, creating secondary damages. Thus quickly dispersing crowd population to safe places in the least time while managing to avoid congestion and/or stampede is an important task with the occurrence of such events. This study presents an optimal evacuation model to meet this goal. By identifying some key themes that contribute to crowd disasters, the model implements a real-time concurrent grouping to ensure at-risk people are guided to safe places in the least time. The underlying rationale of the strategy is to advocate that competition should be replaced with coherence, and people should coordinate and collaborate to move out in an orderly way through scientifically using multiple routes. In doing so, each person receives an equal opportunity to exit the incident site, and the general effectiveness of performing an evacuation is achieved to an optimal level.
To verify the proposed method, we conduct a simulation in which we compare our method with two benchmark cases: random self-evacuation and herding behavior. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can rescue people at risk much faster and more safely than two benchmark cases. We implement the proposed model through a web-based wireless decision support system, which provides a useful tool to both first responders and people affected for time-based crowd management in response to an ongoing crowd incident.},

In the model, the straight walking pedestrians have greater priority walking on a main road, while other pedestrians arrive at the roadside and check to cross. Herding behavior, by which cross-pedestrians communicate with each other and self-organize to compete for common space with their straight walking counterparts, are newly introduced to reflect realistic crossing behavior in a crowed street. The results demonstrate that herding behavior brings adverse consequences to both types of pedestrians as a whole, although the pedestrians adopting prompt herding behavior can benefit. Furthermore, an increased number of crossing points to avoid the inefficiency of the coupled system is also investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies the effect of randomization in the Biham-Middleton-Levine (BML) traffic flow model. It is found that the average velocity exhibits a first-order phase transition from moving phase to jamming phase under periodic boundary conditions. The intermediate stable phase identified in the original deterministic BML model disappears with the introduction of randomization. The average velocity in the moving phase and the critical car density decrease as the randomization probability increases. We have developed
a mean-field theory which successfully predicts the average velocity in the moving phase. Under open boundary conditions, there are only two phases and the maximum current phase does not occur. The dependence of the average velocity, the density and the flow rate on the injection probability in the moving phase have also been obtained through the mean-field theory.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose to couple through optimal control theory, a dynamical crowd evolution models where pedestrians make decisions with a well-defined set of actions and strategies by minimizing their utility function. We explain how situations of this kind can be modelled by making use of differential game theory. By leveraging on some simple examples, we introduce the most fundamental concept of mean field games recently introduced by Lasry and Lions (Lasry and Lions in Japan J Math 2:229-260, 2007). The main interest of mean field games in our work is to simplify the interactions between pedestrians. As a consequence, we derive a continuum formulation of the crowd dynamics and nonlinear
systems involving partial differential equations of crowd models.},

The algorithm extends previous event-driven molecular dynamics algorithms for spheres, and is most efficient when applied to systems of particles with relatively small aspect ratios and with small variations in size. We present a novel partial-update near-neighbor list (NNL) algorithm that is superior to previous algorithms at high densities, without compromising the correctness of the algorithm. This efficiency of the algorithm is further increased for systems of very aspherical particles by using bounding sphere complexes (BSC). These techniques will be useful in any particle-based simulation, including Monte Carlo and time-driven molecular dynamics. Additionally, we allow for a non-vanishing rate of deformation of the boundary, which can be used to model macroscopic strain and also alleviate boundary effects for small systems. In the second part of this series of papers we specialize the algorithm to systems of ellipses and ellipsoids and present performance results for our implementation, demonstrating the practical utility of the algorithm.},

We present performance results for our implementation of the algorithm, demonstrating that for dense systems of very aspherical ellipsoids the novel techniques of using neighbor lists and bounding sphere complexes, offer as much as two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency over direct adaptations of traditional event-driven molecular dynamics algorithms. The practical utility of the algorithm is demonstrated by presenting several interesting physical applications, including the generation of jammed packings inside spherical containers, the study of contact force chains in jammed packings, and melting the densest-known equilibrium crystals of prolate spheroids.},

the social behaviors of insects and of

a number of methods and techniques among which the most

mization technique known as ant colony optimization.
Ant colony optimization (ACO) takes inspiration from the
foraging behavior of some ant species. These ants deposit
pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable
path that should be followed by other members of the colony.
Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solv-
ing optimization problems.
From the early nineties, when the first ant colony opti-
mization algorithm was proposed, ACO attracted the atten-
tion of increasing numbers of researchers and many successful
applications are now available.
Moreover, a substantial corpus of theo-
retical results is becoming available that provides
useful guidelines to researchers and practitioners in further
applications of ACO.
The goal of this article is to introduce ant colony opti-
mization and to survey its most notable applications. Sec-
tion I provides some background information on the
foraging behavior of ants. Section II describes ant colony
optimization and its main variants. Section III surveys the
most notable theoretical results concerning ACO, and Sec-
tion IV illustrates some of its most successful applications.
Section V highlights some currently active research topics,
and Section VI provides an overview of some other algo-
rithms that, although not directly related to ACO, are
nonetheless inspired by the behavior of ants. Section VII
concludes the article.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, pedestrian simulation models are used to predict where, when and why hazardous high density crowd movements arise. However, it is questionable whether models developed for low density situations can be used to simulate high density crowd movements. The objective of this paper is to assess the existent pedestrian simulation models with respect to known crowd phenomena in order to ascertain whether these models can indeed be used for the simulation of high density crowds and to indicate any gaps in the field of pedestrian simulation modeling research. This paper provides a broad, but not exhaustive overview of the crowd motion simulation models of the last decades. It is argued that any model used for crowd simulation should be able to simulate most of the phenomena indicated in this paper. In the paper cellular automata, social force models, velocity-based models, continuum models, hybrid models, behavioral models and network models are discussed. The comparison shows that the models can roughly be divided into slow but highly precise microscopic modeling attempts and very fast but behaviorally questionable macroscopic modeling attempts. Both sets of models have their use, which is highly dependent on the application the model has originally been developed for. Yet, for practical applications, that need both precision and speed, the current pedestrian simulation models are inadequate.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper assesses how exit choice behavior influences the total egress behavior of a crowd during building evacuation. A discrete choice model is proposed to represent pedestrian exit choice decisions during evacuation. The proposed model is based on responses to an Internet questionnaire conducted in the Netherlands and the United States. The results of the Internet questionnaire, consisting of 20 choice experiments by 100 respondents making trade-offs between distance, angular deviation, and group following behavior, are used to estimate a multinomial logit model. Accordingly, a new pedestrian simulation approach that uses a microscopic cellular automata model (EvacPed) is presented. Three levels of decision making are incorporated: global exit choice, regional adaptive route choice, and local operative behavior. Simulations estimate the difference in evacuation time between four exit choice strategies: least distance path, least travel time path, discrete choice incorporating hive knowledge, and discrete choice incorporating vision field. The results suggest that group following behavior has a large impact on the effectiveness of building evacuation.},

  Abstract                 = {In groups of animals only a small proportion of individuals may possess particular information, such as a migration route or the direction to a resource. Individuals may differ in preferred direction resulting in conflicts of interest and, therefore, consensus decisions may have to be made to prevent the group from splitting. Recent theoretical work has shown how leadership and consensus decision making can occur without active signalling or individual recognition. Here we test these predictions experimentally using humans. We found that a small informed minority could guide a group of naive individuals to a target without verbal communication or obvious signalling. Both the time to target and deviation from target were decreased by the presence of informed individuals. When conflicting directional information was given to different group members, the time taken to reach the target was not significantly increased; suggesting that consensus decision making in conflict situations is possible, and highly efficient. Where there was imbalance in the number of informed individuals with conflicting information, the majority dictated group direction. Our results also suggest that the spatial starting position of informed individuals influences group motion, which has implications in terms of crowd control and planning for evacuations.},

In experiment 1, we find that both group size and the presence of uninformed individuals can affect the speed with which small human groups (eight people) decide between two opposing directional preferences and the likelihood of the group splitting. In experiment 2, we show that the spatial positioning of informed individuals within small human groups (10 people) can affect the speed and accuracy of group motion. We find that having a mixture of leaders positioned in the centre and on the edge of a group increases the speed and accuracy with which the group reaches their target. In experiment 3, we use large human crowds (100 and 200 people) to demonstrate that the trends observed from earlier work using small human groups can be applied to larger crowds. We find that only a small minority of informed individuals is needed to guide a large uninformed group. These studies build upon important theoretical and empirical work on leadership and decision making in animal groups.},

Experiments have shown a similar behavior for pedestrians, though the situation is more complicated. The two separate phases in single-file pedestrian movement are a jammed high-density phase and a phase of medium to high density with slowly moving pedestrians. We propose a one-dimensional Stochastic Headway Dependent Velocity Model (SHDV) which is continuous in space but discrete in time. The velocity of each agent depends on its headway and on its velocity. The \{SHDV\} model can qualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed phase separation at high densities and the observed velocity distribution. The \{SHDV\} model provides a deeper understanding of the basic mechanism that leads to the unusual kind of phase separation observed in the experiments.},

While each of the four incidents described (Ibrox 1971, Bradford 1985, Heysel 1985, Hillsborough 1989) can be described as crises in their own right (and led to the deaths of about 250 peo ple in total) it is argued here that they are the effect of a wider crisis of man agement within the football industry, rooted in poor and inadequate manage ment of sports stadia and the crowds that use them. It should be noted from the outset, however, that this is not simply a British phenomena, as the tragedies in Mexico City (1985) and Bastia (1992) indicate and that findings from this research should be of use to all involved in the management of sporting events.},

This was done using a model constructed by Helbing, Farkas, and Vicsek [1]. After reproducing the main results, this model was used to explore the behavior of a mixed crowd, in which only a percentage of the victims were panicking. The main part of the project is then focused on examining architectural adjustments to increase the victim flow out of the room. The outcome of these experiments yielded fruitful results, which at times almost doubled the victim flow velocity. This leaves great room for further more ambitious experiments like full-on evolution of architectural design.},

To deal with this problem, we first focus on a part of the system and report its microscopic behavior. The system is controlled by parameters of inflow and the competitiveness of the pedestrians, and large inflow leads to a congested situation. Through simulations, the metastable state induced by conflicts of pedestrians is observed. The metastability is related to the phase transition from free flow to congestion. The critical condition of the transition is theoretically derived. In addition, we give simulation results of situations with multiple bottlenecks. They imply that local improvement of pedestrian flow sometimes adversely affects the total evacuation time, and that the total optimization of the system is not straightforward.},

To achieve the goal, the gaps in the existing literature were filled by data
collected at the University of Delaware campus in Newark. An equation
of mixed bicycle and motor vehicle following was developed and used
for the representation of longitudinal interaction of vehicles. The program
was implemented in C++ programming language and tested on
real-world data. The resulting software is the first in the world to allow
the inclusion of bicyclists in the analysis of urban transportation by the
means of microscopic simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {The NaSch model is a classical one-dimensional cellular automata (CA) model of
freeway traffic. However, it is not suitable for simulating pedestrian dynamics due to
the kinetic difference between vehicles and pedestrians. Based on NaSch model, we
proposed a new safety interspace model to investigate the single-file pedestrian
stream. We simulated and reproduced Seyfried's experiment in 2006 quantitatively
and use the empirical data to validate our model. We defined the safety interspace as a
linear function of current velocity and introduced a normal distributed random
variable to describe the randomness of spatial cognition. Meanwhile, we extended
NaSch model in space partition from single-grid mode to multi-gird mode to increase
spatial resolution. It was found that through three model perimeters with appropriate
values, the new model could reproduce faithfully the typical form of the fundamental
diagram from empirical data. The velocity-density curve in simulation could indicate
the discontinuity areas in fundamental diagram observed from empirical data. In
addition, we reproduced the stop-and-go waves and phase separation into a stopping
area and an area where pedestrians walk slowly at high density.},

  Abstract                 = {A cellular automata model is presented to simulate the bi-direction pedestrian movement. The pedestrian movement is more complex than vehicular flow for the reason that people are more flexible than cars. Some special technique is introduced considering simple human judgment to make the rules more reasonable. Also the custom in the countries where the pedestrian prefer to walk on the right-hand side of the road are highlighted. By using the model to simulate the bi-direction pedestrian movement, the phase transition phenomena in pedestrian counter flow is presented. Furthermore, the introduction of back stepping breaks the deadlock at the relatively low pedestrian density. By studying the critical density of changing from freely moving state to jammed state with different system sizes and different probabilities of back stepping, we find the critical density increases as the probability of back stepping increases at the same system size. And with the increasing system size, the critical density decreases at the same probability of back stepping according to the scope of system size studied in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficiency is a fundamental requirement in evacuation planning and operations. The â€œfaster-is-slowerâ€� phenomenon in pedestrian evacuation has been observed and deemed a significant obstacle to evacuation efficiency. This paper thus focuses on two aspects of evacuation planning in the case of stadium evacuation. The first is to define a spaceâ€“time use efficiency measure for evaluating the utility of both space and time resources. The second is to propose a pedestrian waiting-time model for directing evacuees to alleviate evacuation bottlenecks. An agent-based simulation approach was employed to test the proposed model in stadium evacuation scenarios. The results demonstrate that compelled, or mandatory, waiting time strategy generated by this model is helpful in improving the spaceâ€“time use efficiency of network links in the evacuation process by virtue of the strategically timed movingâ€“waitingâ€“restarting movement pattern of evacuees. The analysis of spaceâ€“time evacuation paths in this study provides a practical and insightful alternative for measuring evacuation effectiveness. Results of this study compared reasonably against an existing cellular automaton based simulation both in microscopic and macroscopic perspectives. A number of future research directions were presented. },

  Abstract                 = {A good evacuation model should be good to predict actual macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of pedestrian movement. In order to explore pedestrian movement behavior, we conducted controlled experiments of the single-file pedestrian movement, extracted the motion data by using a mean-shift digital image processing algorithm and analyzed the movement characteristics of pedestrians. It is found that both the pedestrian step length and frequency decreases with the increasing global pedestrian density. Furthermore, there is linear relationship between the step frequency and the distance headway of a pedestrian. Based on the characteristics observed from our experiments, we built a continuous distance model (CDM) for the single-file pedestrian movement. Two new insights were taken into account in the movement algorithm. The first one is that, the continuous step length is adopted to avoid unreasonable results caused by the simplification of the step length in traditional discrete models. The second one is that the dependency between the transition probability and the distance headway is introduced for the reason that the transition probability is correlated with the actual step frequency. Simulation results indicated that there is a close agreement on the flow-density and velocityâ€“density relations between the experiments and modeling. Moreover, it is found that the \{CDM\} model is capable of reproducing microscopic features for the scenario with high density. },

The basic parameters such as flow, density and velocity of pedestrians in the exit area are measured. The exit-selecting phenomenon in the experiment is analyzed, and it is found that pedestrians prefer selecting the closer exit even though the other exit is only a little far. In order to understand the phenomenon, we reproduce the experiment process with a modified biased random walk model, in which the preference of closer exit is achieved using the drift direction and the drift force. Our simulation results afford a calibrated value of the drift force, especially when it is 0.56, there is good agreement between the simulation results and the experimental results on the number of pedestrians selecting the closer exit, the average velocity through the exits, the cumulative distribution of the instantaneous velocity and the fundamental diagram of the flow through exits. According to the further simulation results, it is found that pedestrians tend to select the exit with shorter distance to them, especially when the people density is small or medium. But if the density is large enough, the flow rates of the two exits will become comparable because of the detour behaviors. It reflects the fact that a crowd of people may not be rational to optimize the usage of multi-exits, especially in an emergency.},

  Abstract                 = {A survey of crowd movement was recently performed at the main railway station in Wuhan City, China during the traditional Chinese spring festival in 2003. The crowd was formed by passengers in the exit tunnel of the station after getting off a train. The observed maximum density of the crowd and maximum speed of the fastest individual were 2.8 persons/m2 and 1.5 m/s, respectively. The observed crowd movement speed and flow were used to determine values of the key parameters for a crowd dynamics model previously proposed by the authors. The crowd dynamics model is based on simulating the global movement of each individual under the influence of the surrounding crowd. The crowd dynamics model suggests that the crowd movement speed is dominated by two factors: (1) the front?back inter-person effect and (2) the pedestrian's self-driving motivation. The first effect gives a logarithmic relationship between the crowd speed and crowd density. The second factor depends on the individual's motivation, which is driven by people trying to divorce themselves from the control of the crowd movement. The observations and prediction model are useful tools to guide the design of public traffic systems for effective crowd dispersal.},

Here we discuss an emerging approach to this problem which is based on the quantitative methods of statistical physics. We demonstrate that in cases when the interactions between the members of a group are relatively well defined (e.g, pedestrian traffic, synchronization, panic) the corresponding models reproduce relevant aspects of the observed phenomena. In particular, people moving in the same environment typically develop specific patterns of collective motion including the formation of lanes, flocking or jamming at bottlenecks. We simulate such phenomena assuming realistic interactions between particles representing humans. The two specific cases to be discussed in more detail are waves produced by crowds at large sporting events and the main features of pedestrian escape panic under various conditions. Our models allow prediction of crowd behavior even in cases when experimental methods are obviously not applicable and, thus, are expected to be useful in assessing the level of security in situations involving large groups of excited people.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In previous studies the authors have shown passengersâ€™ boarding and alighting times for the Transantiago system obtained at the Pedestrian Accessibility and Movement Environment Laboratory (PAMELA) of University College London. Following this line of research, the aim of this paper is to demonstrate the existence of pedestrian saturation flows in public transport doors and show some values of this variable under different conditions. The methodology to achieve this aim was real-scale experiments performed in both \{PAMELA\} and the Human Dynamics Laboratory at Universidad de los Andes in Santiago de Chile. Different groups of people getting off a mock-up of a public transport vehicle were recorded by means of video cameras. The videos were then visually processed to find values of passenger saturation flow according to door configurations. The variables studied were the vertical gap between the platform and the vehicle chassis and the width of the door. Results indicate that it is possible to define values of passenger saturation flows for different characteristics of public transport doors. These values proved to be statistically sensitive to both the vertical gap and the width of the door. In addition, results indicate that there seems to be both a vertical gap and a door width for which the flow of passenger reaches its optimum rate. },

By contrasting present and future status of these conditions a vision emerges where non-OECD passenger travel increases of up to 200% can be accommodated via strong investments in transit and non-motorized modes and a recasting of informal transport services into self-organized systems, with lower levels of car ownership and avoidance of carbon emissions. Reductions in motorized travel are also necessary from \{OECD\} countries; the focus there is given to what level of pricing and regulatory interventions could change behavior. The articulation of detailed visions can help clarify and prioritize areas where policy efforts can have great impact. Strong actions are necessary from both regions. },

  Abstract                 = { This paper presents a method for robot motion planning in dynamic environments. It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the cur rent positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first- order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot ve locities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This article presents a new model of stationary bidirectional pedestrian flow. Starting out from microscopic first principles, a bidirectional fundamental diagram (FD) is derived that defines direction-specific flow rates as functions of direction-specific densities. The \{FD\} yields non-negative and bounded flows and guarantees that the instantaneous density changes that would result from these flows stay bounded between zero and jam density. In its minimal configuration, it uses just as many parameters as a unidirectional triangular FD: maximum walking speed, jam density, a collision avoidance parameter (from which the backward wave speed can be derived). A one-on-one mapping between the parameters guiding uni- and bidirectional pedestrian flows is proposed and both conceptually and empirically justified. Generalizations of the \{FD\} that maintain its desirable properties turn out to be straightforward by making its parameters density-dependent. The \{FD\} performs very well in comparisons against simulated and real data. },

  Abstract                 = {Occupant safety in places of entertainment is assessed by a model of hazard and vulnerability. Fire hazards of different strength are simulated numerically in parameter studies with different fire growth coefficients. Hereby empirical correlations of the available safe escape time with the fire growth coefficient, the tenability criteria, and the size as well as the fire protection infrastructure of an assembly room are found. The evacuation process consists of the pre-movement time, which depends on the fire growth coefficient, and the movement time, which is calculated by capacity analysis. Limit states are expressed by critical fire growth coefficients for different tenability criteria. The probability of occurrence of serious incidents in assembly rooms as well as the individual risk of being seriously affected by a fire is determined regarding the German building code. The quantitative results are promising in comparison with literature data. The methodology can also be used to illustrate how the risk is affected by changes in the fire safety design. An indication on how occupant safety behaves in other countries is given by a comparison of exit-flow times according to nine different building codes.},

As the travel times are influenced by the design occupant densities which range from 0.5 to 4 p/m2 for places of entertainment, a second comparison is made with a normalized density of 4 p/m2. Here the results also scatter by a factor of three. The implications on occupant safety are discussed with regard to potential fire scenarios.},

Several authors have called attention to the fact that placing an obstacle near the exit improves the evacuation time of the room (Helbing et al. (2000, 2005) [2] and [8], Hughes (2003) [6], Johansson and Helbing (2003) [16], Piccoli and Tosin (2009) [5]). We studied this effect in the context of the "social force model" (Helbing et al. (2000) [2]). We show that placing an obstacle does not guarantee, by itself, better chances of survival for all pedestrians. The way they choose to avoid the obstacle is critical for their own performance. We found not only that the faster they try to escape, the slower they get out ("faster is slower" effect), but also, the short cut they might take in order to get to the exit will probably do no better ("clever is not always better" effect).},

  Abstract                 = {The present report investigates the velocity of people on stairs using experiments. The purpose of the study is to derive design values for the walking velocities for people moving up or down a stair. This study presents the data as a function ofthe interperson distance between people on the stair. The interperson distance is the distance between the centres of bodies, seen from above, in the route. Traditionally the velocity assessment of people moving on stairs is based on a function of the population density in the passage. This measure makes it somewhat difficult to use the data presented by other researchers, as it forces the designer to choose a population density. This chosen density may then not be valid in the real case as the circumstances change with time.
New computer software make it possible to assess the velocity using the interperson distance. It is now possible to model the dynamics of the evacuation process. Data from other studies can be translated to fit this new approach which makes the suggested design parameter more robust. 
The experiments were conducted using students as test persons. The students walked on different types of stairs and the sequences were videofilmed. The film was then analysed using a software developed for this purpose. The resulting data can be saved on a standard spreadsheet format. 
The results indicate a constant velocity, independent of the interperson distance above a certain distance. Below this point the velocity decreases rapidly to zero. The relationship between the velocity and the interperson distance is very similar to a stepfunction. The design velocities for stairs were derived for movement both up and down staircases. The mean velocity upstairs was 0.55 mls until the breakpoint in interperson distance was reached. The velocity downstairs was 0.7 mls until the same breakpoint in interperson distance was attained.
The velocity for spiral stairs was also measured and a design value was derived as 0.55 mls for downstairs movement. No measurements were made for upstairs movement on spiral stairs. As the movement pattern is very different on spiral stairs compared to straight stairs a decrease in velocity was not observed. On spiral stairs the people are moving after eachother in a line, which is not the condition on straight staircases. If the interperson distance decreases on spiral stairs the probability of falling increases and therefore only
a few observations were made at low interperson distances. The presented design value for spiral stairs is valid until an interperson distance of 0.7 m. Shorter distances are not likely to occur. Instead a crowd will form on the landing before the staircase.},

Such “exemplars” can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called “affinity propagation,” which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

  Abstract                 = {To understand human behavior, it is important to know under what conditions people deviate from selfish rationality. This study explores the interaction of natural survival instincts and internalized social norms using data on the sinking of the Titanic and the Lusitania. We show that time pressure appears to be crucial when explaining behavior under extreme conditions of life and death. Even though the two vessels and the composition of their passengers were quite similar, the behavior of the individuals on board was dramatically different. On the Lusitania, selfish behavior dominated (which corresponds to the classical homo economicus); on the Titanic, social norms and social status (class) dominated,
which contradicts standard economics. This difference could be attributed to the fact that the Lusitania sank in 18 min, creating a situation in which the short-run flight impulse dominated behavior. On the slowly sinking Titanic (2 h, 40 min), there was time for socially determined behavioral patterns to reemerge. Maritime disasters are traditionally not analyzed in a comparative manner with advanced statistical (econometric) techniques using individual data of the passengers and crew. Knowing human behavior under extreme conditions provides insight into how widely human behavior can vary, depending on differing external conditions.},

The characteristics of a crowd flow passing through ticket gates were identified, and numerical values were derived to estimate the evacuation time. A total of 48 subjects were asked to pass through a ticket gate with three passages and three different wide passages, where each width was the same as the sum of the three passage widths of the ticket gate. The crowd flow through the ticket gate was simulated with the pedestrian simulation model SimTread. The results of this study elucidated the flow rate through the ticket gates and the numerical values to calculate the time for evacuation planning. },

Results suggest that characteristics of collision avoidance on stairs are different from those in a busy flat space. On stairs, pedestrians tended to detour at the beginning of a flight to avoid collision with another pedestrian already on the stairs. The authors call this lane collision avoidance. The side preference of pedestrians on stairs and the handedness of two-lane flows were explored. On dextral staircases, most pedestrians chose the right-hand side for collision avoidance, whereas in sinistral staircases, pedestrians did not necessarily choose the right-hand side. Investigation of the relative position of one pedestrian to another leading pedestrian showed that following pedestrians tended to shift laterally in relation to a leading pedestrian when the 'front - back' interpersonal distance between them was small. The obtained knowledge is useful for the development of pedestrian simulations.},

These rules are among the only known CA rules for which the shape of the fundamental diagram has been rigorously derived. In addition, their fundamental diagrams contain nonlinear segments, as opposed to majority of number conserving CA which exhibit piecewise linear diagrams. We found that the nature of singularities in the fundamental diagram of these rules is the same as for rules with piecewise linear diagrams. The current converges toward its equilibrium value like t-1/2, and the critical exponent sz is equal to 1. This supports the conjecture of universal behavior at singularities in number-conserving rules. We discuss properties of phase transitions occurring at singularities as well as properties of the intermediate phase.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the behavior of walkers sidling through the crowd in the counter flow of pedestrian. When a walker enters the crowd, he turns himself sidelong to avoid a collision and edge through the crowd. The biased random walk model is extended to take into account the sidle effect. We present three models. The first model is for the pedestrians, which walk normally face to face. In the second model, pedestrian walks only sideways. In the third model, a walker turns himself sidelong if he enters the crowd, edges through the crowd, and returns normal walk if congestion disappears. It is shown that the walking sideways is faster than the normal walk, reduces the congestion, and the jamming transition point becomes lower than that of the normal walk. The jam cluster oscillates highly around the channel center near the jamming transition point in the third model.},

The coupling between the two processes occurs at one common point at which particles are injected; the process can be controlled by directing incoming individuals into either of the two escape routes. On the basis of a mean-field approach we determine the phase behaviour of the model, and analytically compute optimal control strategies, maximizing the total current through the system. Results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also show that dynamic intervention, exploiting fluctuations about the mean-field stationary state, can lead to a further increase in total current.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we incorporate a limitation on the interaction range between neighboring vehicles into the cellular automaton model proposed by Gao and Jiang et al. [K. Gao, R. Jiang, S. X. Hu, B. H. Wang and Q. S. Wu, Phys. Rev. E 76 (2007) 026105], which was established within the framework of Kerner's three-phase traffic theory and has been shown to be able to reproduce the three-phase traffic flow. This modification eliminates an unrealistic phenomenon found in the previous model, where the velocity-adaptation effect between neighboring vehicles can exist even if those vehicles are infinitely far away from each other. Therefore, in the improved model, we regulate that such interactions can only occur within a finite distance. For simplicity, we suppose a constant value to describe this distance in this paper. As a result, when compared to the previous model, the improved model mainly simulates the following results which are believed to be an improvement. (1) The improved model successfully reproduces the expected discontinuous transition
from free flow to synchronized flow and the related ``moving synchronized flow pattern'', which are both absent in the original model but have been observed in real traffic. (2) The improved model simulates the correlation functions, time headway distributions and optimal velocity functions which are all more consistent with the empirical data than the previous model and most of the other models published before. (3) Together with the previous two models considering the velocity-difference effect, this model finally accomplishes a significative process of developing traffic flow models from the traditional ``fundamental diagram approach'' to the three-phase traffic theory. This process should be helpful for us to understand the traffic dynamics and mechanics further and deeper.},

Instead of just measuring the evacuation times, we have analyzed the probability distribution of the time lapses between consecutive individuals. We show how it displays a power-law tail. This method displays clearly the Faster Is Slower effect, and also allows to assess the impact of several tactics that can be put in place to alleviate the problem. },

For a range of outlet sizes, we measure some properties of the arches such as the number of particles involved, the span, the aspect ratio, and the angles between mutually stabilizing particles. These measurements shed light on the role of frictional tangential forces in arching. In addition, we find that arches tend to adopt an aspect ratio (the quotient between height and half the span) close to 1, suggesting an isotropic load. The comparison of the experimental results with data from numerical models of the arches formed in the bulk of a granular column reveals the similarities of both, as well as some limitations in the few existing models.},

We investigate the stationarity of the distribution of time lags between instants when two successive pedestrians cross the exit. The exponential tail of the distribution is shown to gradually vanish. Taking fluctuations apart, the time lags decrease in time till there are only about 50 pedestrians in the room, then they start to increase. This suggests that at the last stage the flow is laminar. In the first stage, clogging events slow the evacuation down. As they are more likely for larger crowds, the flow is not stationary. The data are investigated with detrended fluctuation analysis and return interval statistics, and no phase transition is found between the stages of the process.},

  Abstract                 = {In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird versucht, den Fu{\ss}g\"angerverkehr mit einem simulationstechnischen Ansatz zu erfassen und zu quantifizieren.

Existierende Simulationsmodelle behandeln den Fu{\ss}g\"angerverkehr aus einer makroskopischen Sicht und gehen von einem quasistation\"aren Flu{\ss} der Fu{\ss}g\"anger aus. Diese Modelle sind dadurch nicht in der Lage, kurzfristige Spitzenbelastungen des Fu{\ss}g\"angerstromes nachzubilden. 
Das vorliegende Modell arbeitet auf der Ebene der Betrachtung der einzelnen Individuen und unterteilt diese in verhaltenshomogene Gruppen. Die Bewegung basiert auf einem Routenmodell, das die Gesamtstrecke einer Person zwischen ihrem Ursprung und ihrem Ziel in eine Reihe von Zwischenzielen unterteilt. Diese Zwischenziele sind tempor\"arer Natur und werden gruppenspezifisch durch Attraktivit\"atskriterien erzeugt, wobei sie gewissen Bedingungen zu gehorchen haben, wie Sichtbarkeit und Erreichbarkeit. Unmittelbar vor errerichen des Zwischenzieles -- die Ann\"aherung gen\"ugt dem Algorithmus -- w\"ahlt der Fu{\ss}g\"anger sein n\"achstes Ziel.
Hindernisse und Engstellen werden ebenso bei der Knotengenerierung ber\"ucksichtigt, wie Attraktivitt\"atsunterschiede der Knoten f\"ur verschiedene Gruppen. Das Modell ber\"ucksichtigt den inversen Zusammenhang zwischen der Geschwindigkeit und der Dichte dahingehend, da{\ss} bei h\"oherer Diche Abweichungen der Bewegungslinie von der direkten Verbindung entstehen, die zu einer reduzierten Geschwindigkeit in der Hauptbewegungsrichtung f\"uhren.
Die Bewegung wird in diskreten Zeitintervallen simuliert. Die Modellvorstellung basiert auf einer Zellenl\"osung, die die Bewegungsebene in hexagonale Zellen aufteilt. Jede Zelle beinhaltet genau 1 Person, wobei die Gr\"o{\ss}e der Zelle eine Funktion der Dichte des Fu{\ss}g\"angerstromes ist. Damit kann auf das verringerte Abstandsverhalten bei h\"oherer Dichte eingegangen werden.
Das hier vorgestellte Modell orintiert sich an einem kanalisierten, unidirektionslen, ebenen Fu{\ss}g\"angerstrom. Zur Simulation von Gegenverkehr, Kreuzungen oder Treppen etc. sind Erweiterungen des Modells notwendig.},

The IMU measurements are processed through a conventional inertial navigation system (INS) algorithm and are then integrated with HSGPS receiver measurements and dynamics derived constraint measurements using a tightly coupled integration strategy. The ability of INS to bridge the navigation solution is evaluated through field tests conducted indoors and in severely signal degraded forest environments.

  Abstract                 = {The perception of absolute distance has been assumed to be important in the perception of the size of objects and the depth between them. A different hypothesis is proposed. It is asserted that perceived relative size and distance are the primary psychological phenomena with perceived absolute distance derived from the perceptual summing of perceived relative depths. In agreement with this point-of-view, it is stressed that relative rather than absolute retinal extents are the determiners of visually p'erceived extents. A principle called the â€œadjacency principleâ€� is identified as perceptually organizing the relative retinal stimuli. This principle states that the apparent size or position of any object in the field of view is determined by whatever size or distance cues occur between it and adjacent objects. Some evidence for the adjacency principle is discussed and some consequences of the principle are considered. On admet gÃ©nÃ©ralement que la perception de la distance absolue est un facteur important de la perception de la dimension des objets et de la profondeur qui les separe. On propose une hypothÃ¨se diffÃ©rente, selon laquelle la dimension relative et la distance perÃ§ues sont les phÃ©nomÃ¨nes psychologiques primaires, tandis que la perception de la distance absolue dÃ©rive d'une sommation des profondeurs relatives perÃ§ues. En accord avec ce point de vue, on insiste sur le fait que lesÃ©carts perÃ§ues visuellement sont dÃ©terminÃ©s plutoË†t par lesÃ©carts rÃ©tiniens relatifs que par lesÃ©carts absolus. On a identifiÃ©un principe, nommÃ©â€œprincipe de contiguitÃ©â€�, comme le facteur perceptuel qui organise les stimuli rÃ©tiniens relatifs. Ce principeÃ©tablit que la dimension apparente ou la position d'un objet quelconque du champ visuel est dÃ©terminÃ©par tout guide de taille ou de distance qui existe entre lui et les objets adjacents. On discute quelques faits qui sont en faveur du principe de contiguitÃ©et onÃ©tudie quelques consÃ©quences de ce principe. Es wurde angenommen, dass die Wahrnehmung des absoluten Abstandes fÃ¼r die Wahrnehmung der GrÃ¶sse und des Tiefenabstandes von Objekten bedeutsam sei. Eine neue Hypothese wird vorgeschlagen. Es wird behauptet, dass die wahrgenommene relative GrÃ¶sse und der Abstand die primÃ¤ren psychologischen Erscheinungen sind, wobei der wahrgenommene absolute Abstand sich durch Summation der wahrgenommenen relativen TiefenabstÃ¤nde in der Wahrnehmung herleitet. In Ubereinstimmung mit diesem Gesichtspunkt wird betont, dass vielmehr relative als absolute AbstÃ¤nde auf der Retina bestimmend fÃ¼r visuell wahrgenommene Ausdehnungen sind. Ein Prinzip, das â€œadjacency principleâ€� (Nachbarschaftsprinzip) genannt wird, erweist sich als verantwortlich fÃ¼r die wahrnehmungsgemÃ¤sse Organisation der realtiven Reize auf der Netzhaut. Das Prinzip legt fest, dass die scheinbare GrÃ¶sse oder Lage eines Objektes im Gesichtsfeld dadurch bestimmt ist, dass bei einer bestimmten GrÃ¶sse oder einem bestimmten Abstand gewisse Marken zwischen ihm und dem benachbarten Objekt erscheinen. Eine BeweismÃ¶glichkeit fÃ¼r das Nachbarschaftsprinzip wird diskutiert und einige Folgerungen aus dem Prinzip werden betrachtet.},

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Levy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

  Abstract                 = {Consistency is a crucial prerequisite for a large number of relevant applications of 3D city models, which have become more and more important in GIS. Users need efficient and reliable consistency checking tools in order to be able to assess the suitability of spatial data for their applications. In this paper we provide the theoretical foundations for such tools by defining an axiomatic characterization of 3D city models. These axioms are effective and efficiently supported by recent spatial database management systems and methods of
Computational Geometry or Computer Graphics. They are equivalent to the topological concept of the 3D city model presented in this paper, thereby guaranteeing the reliability of the method. Hence, each error is detected by the axioms, and each violation of the axioms is in fact an error. This property, which is proven formally, is not guaranteed by existing approaches. The efficiency of the method stems from its locality: in most cases, consistency checks can safely be restricted to single components, which are defined topologically. We
show how a 3D city model can be decomposed into such components which are either topologically equivalent to a disk, a sphere, or a torus, enabling the modeling of the terrain, of
buildings and other constructions, and of bridges and tunnels, which are handles from a mathematical point of view. This enables a modular design of the axioms by defining axioms
for each topological component and for the aggregation of the components. Finally, a sound, consistent concept for aggregating features, i.e. semantical objects like buildings or rooms, to complex features is presented.},

The concept of attributed grammars is adapted to generate the indoor model which meets the two essential preconditions for the automatic derivation of connectivity information for route graphs: consistency, which enables the identification of neighbouring spaces, and the representation of semantics. The first precondition is met by implementing a model that has been developed earlier and which provably assures consistency between geometry and topology. This gives a contrast to earlier approaches for generating buildings by grammars. Topology is represented by constraints generated by the grammar rules and is maintained by constraint reasoning methods. Semantic aspects being relevant for deriving the connectivity relation been spaces are represented according to CityGML. The generation of the indoor model by grammar rules requires only a small number of observations, and the derivation of the route graph from the indoor model is accomplished automatically.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the concept of building evacuation and the factors that affect the emergency egress time. It argues that the total evacuation time can be divided into three components: the time to recognize a dangerous situation, the time to decide for evacuation and the time for the movement towards safety. The last component, the egress time, is studied closely in this paper. When the capacity of a walkway is known, this component can be calculated. The capacity however is affected by a number of factors. Through two field studies the effects of the motivation of people to move and the slope of stairs on capacity have been tested. It appears that initially motivation has an accelerating effect, but as the number of people per square meter grows their speed decreases. Also the steeper the slope of stairs, the slower people will move on them. Furthermore the value for capacity used in design and egress time calculations is looked upon. Various researchers have come up with different values. Some recommend the use of the maximum value, which gives the minimum egress time, while others recommend the use of a mean value for capacity, which gives a mean value for egress time. This paper discusses the advantages of the use of a mean value over the use of a maximum value, and thus of the use of an average over a minimum egress time.},

The book was well received and has served as both a reference work for practitioners and a textbook for students. Public transportation is a dynamic subject with newly published material appearing frequently and issues constantly changing as they reflect new societal values and priorities. In revising the book the editors have endeavored to recognize new and emerging areas as well as to update and modernize continuing ones. Because of the book's broad coverage, the subtitle used in the first edition has been dropped. The editors have also changed the format of the individual chapters to include examples and case studies that serve to illustrate major points and have added discussion questions and references to supplement classroom lectures. The book is divided into seven parts, I: Historical Development, II: Systems and Technologies, III: Comparing Alternatives, IV: Planning, V: Management and Operations, VI: Policy Considerations, and VII: The Future.},

We have established useful parameter ranges for simulations, and have made a link between these parameters and x-parameters in Flory-Huggins-type models. This is possible because the equation of state of the DPD fluid is essentially quadratic in density. This link opens the way to do large scale simulations, effectively describing millions of atoms, by firstly performing simulations of molecular fragments retaining all atomistic details to derive x-parameters, then secondly using these results as input to a DPD simulation to study the formation of micelles, networks, mesophases and so forth. As an example application, we have calculated the interfacial tension s between homopolymer melts as a function of x and N and have found a universal scaling collapse when s/r kBTx0.4 is plotted against xN for N.1. We also discuss the use of DPD to simulate the dynamics of mesoscopic systems, and indicate a possible problem with the timescale separation between particle diffusion and momentum diffusion (viscosity).},

  Abstract                 = {We consider a microscopic model (a system of self-propelled particles) to study the behaviour of a large group of pedestrians walking in a corridor. Our point of interest is the effect of anisotropic interactions on the global behaviour of the crowd. The anisotropy we have in mind reflects the fact that people do not perceive (i.e.Â see, hear, feel or smell) their environment equally well in all directions. The dynamics of the individuals in our model follow from a system of Newton-like equations in the overdamped limit. The instantaneous velocity is modelled in such a way that it accounts for the angle at which an individual perceives another individual. We investigate the effects of this perception anisotropy by means of simulations, very much in the spirit of molecular dynamics. We define a number of characteristic quantifiers (including the polarization index and Morisita index) that serve as measures, for example, for organization and clustering, and we use these indices to investigate the influence of anisotropy on the global behaviour of the crowd. The goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of this model; extensive statistical analysis of simulation data and reproducing any specific real-life situation are beyond its scope.},

Several properties of this cell transmission model are explored. The method can be used to predict the evolution of pedestrian flow over time and space in indoor areas with internal obstacles and to investigate the collection, spillback, and dissipation behavior of pedestrians passing through a bottleneck. The cell transmission model is further extended to imitate the movements of multiple flows of pedestrians with different destinations. An algorithm based on generalized cell potential is also developed to assign the pedestrian flow.},

The positions of the pedestrians are then updated in each small time interval. In this way, a barrier between the pedestrians can be generated, and after updating their positions the pedestrians do not overlap with each other. The modified model is compared to the original model through a simulation of the evacuation process of pedestrians in a closed area. The simulation results indicate that the modified model is superior to the original model in several aspects.},

Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can simulate two classes of phenomena that cannot be reproduced accurately by those existing methods.

Based on these forms of behavior, a microscopic pedestrian model with discrete space representation is developed. In the model, two algorithms are proposed to describe the movement of pedestrians to a destination under conditions of both good and zero visibility, respectively. Through numerical simulations, the ability of the model to reproduce the behavior observed in the experiments is verified.

These developments mainly include the determination of desired direction of pedestrians in the walkways, the action of pedestrians encountering walls around corner, and the generation of pedestrians in the walkways at the initial time of each simulation. Using the developed model, the effects, which the walkway corner and pedestrian preference to inside routes have on the pedestrian queue, trajectory and flow-density relation, are investigated by numerical simulations. Simulation results indicate that, under certain conditions, increasing the turning degree of corner has negative impact on the pedestrian queues; the effects of the pedestrian preference to inside routes on the pedestrian queues and flows are not still positive; the flow-density relation of pedestrian flow through walkways with corners, compared with that of pedestrian flow through bottleneck, is more complex, and in different region partition in the walkways, different relation of flow to initial density can be shown.},

The key challenge in modeling crowds is to develop rules that guide how the particles or agents interact with each other in a way that faithfully reproduces paths and behaviors commonly seen in real human crowds. Here, we propose a simple and intuitive formulation of these rules based on biomechanical measurements and the principle of least effort. We present a constrained optimization method to compute collision-free paths of minimum caloric energy for each agent, from which collective crowd behaviors can be reproduced. We show that our method reproduces common crowd phenomena, such as arching and self-organization into lanes. We also validate the flow rates and paths produced by our method and compare them to those of real-world crowd trajectories.},

The current view is seen as a simplification that may lead to an overly optimistic view of the achievable flow rates. Analyzed data are presented in order to demonstrate the impact that the actual use of the doorway and its design can have upon the flow rate generated. These data are then supported by the use of numerical simulations to demonstrate the impact that this overestimation can have upon the design process. It is contended that the specific flow rate assumed for a doorway should take into consideration not only its width, but also the design of the doorway (i.e., the opening and closing mechanism) and how evacuees behave in response to it. The issues raised have implications for the governing codes/regulations, engineering guidance and on the development of future computational egress models. },

  Abstract                 = {FuÃŸgÃ¤ngersimulationen werden eingesetzt, um Fluchtwegsysteme in komplexen baulichen Anlagen zu planen, zu betreiben und zu optimieren. Die Simulationsprogramme basieren in der Regel auf mikroskopischen Modellen, welche die Dynamik einzelner FuÃŸgÃ¤nger und ihre rÃ¤umliche Orientierung mit mathematischen Formeln beschreiben.
Im Fokus dieser Arbeit stehen das Soziale KrÃ¤fte-Modell und ein graphenbasiertes Navigationsmodell. Das Soziale KrÃ¤fte-Modell beschreibt die individuelle Dynamik mit anziehenden und abstoÃŸenden KrÃ¤ften, ein Navigationsgraph reprÃ¤sentiert Wege in einem GebÃ¤ude mit Knoten als lokale Ziele und Kanten als Sichtverbindungen. FÃ¼r beide Schwerpunkte werden grundlegende AnsÃ¤tze diskutiert, Defizite erlÃ¤utert und neue mathematische Methoden formuliert. Das Soziale KrÃ¤fte-Modell wird um Methoden erweitert, die den individuellen dynamischen Platzbedarf inklusive Schritten und seitlichen Schwankungen, die Fokussierung der individuellen Sicht bis hin zum Tunnelblick und das individuelle Abstandhalten zu fremden FuÃŸgÃ¤ngern und Hindernissen abhÃ¤ngig von der Relativgeschwindigkeit beschreiben. BezÃ¼glich der Struktur von Navigationsgraphen liefert diese Arbeit neue Kriterien, um die Lage und Form von Zielknoten bei Ecken realistisch festzulegen und um Sichtkanten auf eine minimale Menge zu reduzieren. DarÃ¼ber hinaus werden eine Regionenalgebra fÃ¼r Treppen und Rolltreppen und ein A-Stern-Algorithmus zur heuristischen Navigation dargelegt.
Durch die vorgenommenen Modifikationen und Weiterentwicklungen reproduziert das Soziale KrÃ¤fte-Modell den Zusammenhang zwischen Dichte und Geschwindigkeit der FuÃŸgÃ¤ngerdynamik plausibel und zuverlÃ¤ssig. Dieses wird im Rahmen einer Modellvalidierung fÃ¼r FuÃŸgÃ¤ngerfolgen und -schlangen sowie fÃ¼r unidirektionale Staus vor Engstellen gezeigt. Dabei wird auch auf kollektive Bewegungsmuster wie Dichtewellen und bidirektionale Bahnen eingegangen. Im Zuge der Validierung wird ein genetischer Algorithmus hergeleitet, mit dem sich die Parameter und damit das Verhalten eines Bewegungsmodells an beliebige Bewegungsszenarien und Zielfunktionen anpassen lassen. Zur Veranschaulichung wird ein Fundamentaldiagramm als Zielfunktion definiert.
Zum Abschluss dieser Arbeit wird das modifizierte Modell angewendet, um die FuÃŸgÃ¤ngerdynamik im Hauptbahnhof Hannover exemplarisch zu untersuchen.},

Starting from a given model (scenario), we show how to automatically derive a visibility graph. This graph is used as the underlying structure for routing pedestrians from their sources to their destinations. Based on this graph, we search for fastest routes by means of a conventional Dijkstra algorithm where we assign dynamically changing travel times as edge weights. To update the shortest paths due to
changing edge weights, we introduce a heuristic A* algorithm, which is faster in finding optimal paths. We compare the results of our approach to a variant where we assign Euclidean distances as static edge weights. Additionally, we show that the A* algorithm has a better performance in finding the shortest path for most cases.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedestrians walking in corridors tend to maintain a clearance from the walls and any stationary obstacles that they pass, thus, space within corridors is never fully utilized. A number of researchers have therefore suggested that an effective width reduction should be subtracted from the gross width to obtain an effective corridor for design purposes. There are discrepancies however, in the magnitude of the effective width reductions that are suggested in the literature. A proposed definition and method for calculating effective width reductions from pedestrian data is presented. Pedestrian distributions observed in a survey conducted in a pedestrian tunnel at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, were used to calculate effective width reductions under various conditions. The reductions calculated for walls ranged between 5.5 in. and 8.7 in. (140 mm and 220 mm). This is less than one third of the 18 in. (46 cm) suggested by most researchers. Experimentation with obstacles,such as a waste recepticle adjacent to one wall, resulted in even lower effective width reductions. It is concluded that effective width reductions generally assumed in current design practices are overestimated.},

The generic phase diagram for systems with short-ranged interactions is governed by a simple extremal principle for the macroscopic current, which results from an interplay of density fluctuations with the motion of shocks. In systems with more than one extremum in the current-density relation, one finds a minimal current phase even though the boundaries support a higher current. The boundary layers of the critical minimal current and maximal current phases are argued to be of a universal form. The predictions of the theory are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations of the two-parameter family of stochastic particle hopping models of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn and by analytical results for a related cellular automaton with deterministic bulk dynamics. The effect of disorder in the particle jump rates on the boundary layer profile is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Here, we report on a new approach for adaptive path finding in microscopic simulations of pedestrian dynamics. The approach extends a widely used concept based on scalar navigation field -- the so-called floor field method. Adopting a continuum perspective, navigation fields used in our approach correspond to the shortest distances to the pedestrian's targets with respect to arbitrary metrics, e.g. metrics depending on the local terrain. If the metric correlates inversely with the expected speed, these distances could be
interpreted as expected travel times. Following this approach, it is guaranteed that virtual pedestrians navigate along the steepest descent of the navigation field and thus follow geodesics. Using the Eikonal equation, i.e. a continuum model, navigation fields can be determined with respect to arbitrary metrics in an efficient manner. The fast marching method used in this work offers a fast method to solve the Eikonal equation (complexity N log N, where N is degree of freedom). Increasing computational efforts with respect to classical
approaches only mildly, the consideration of locally varying metrics allows a realistic adaptive movement behavior like the avoidance of certain terrains. The method is outlined using a simple cellular automaton approach. Extensions to other microscopic models, e.g. cellular automata approaches or social force models, are possible.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a modeling process in order to produce a realistic simulation of crowds in the ancient Greek agora of Argos. This place was a social theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place: interpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and global collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming.

In this paper, we focus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative emergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent self-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined environment and under a common fate, collective structures appear spontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues, curls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant features to enhance the realism -more precisely the "truthfulness" - of models of this kind of collective phenomena.
We assume that this truthfulness is strongly associated with the concept of emergence: evolutions are not predetermined by the individual characters, but emerge from the interaction of numerous characters. The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis of small changes.
This paper demonstrates that the physically-based interacting particles system is an adequate candidate to model emergent crowd effects: it associates a large number of elementary dynamic actors via elementary non-linear dynamic interactions. Our model of the scene is regulated as a large, dynamically coupled network of second order differential automata.
We take advantage of symbolic non-photorealistic and efficient visualization to render the style of the person, rather than the person itself. As an artistic representation, NPR reinforces the symbolic acceptance of the scene by the observer, triggering an immediate and intuitive recognition of the scene as a plausible scene from ancient Greece.},

These include microscopic (particle-based), mesoscopic (gas-kinetic), and macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) models. Attention is also paid to the formulation of a micro-macro link, to aspects of universality, and to other unifying concepts, such as a general modeling framework for self-driven many-particle systems, including spin systems. While the primary focus is upon vehicle and pedestrian traffic, applications to biological or socio-economic systems such as bacterial colonies, flocks of birds, panics, and stock market dynamics are touched upon as well.},

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic model is developed to describe behavioral changes by imitative pair interactions of individuals. 'Microscopic' assumptions on the specific form of the imitative processes lead to a stochastic version of the game dynamical equations, which means that the approximate mean value equations of these equations are the game dynamical equations of evolutionary game theory.
The stochastic version of the game dynamical equations allows the derivation of covariance equations. These should always be solved along with the ordinary game dynamical equations. On the one hand, the average behavior is affected by the covariances so that the game dynamical equations must be corrected for increasing covariances; otherwise they may become invalid in the course of time. On the other hand, the covariances are a measure of the reliability of game dynamical descriptions. An increase of the covariances beyond a critical value indicates a phase transition, i.e. a sudden change in the properties of the social system under consideration.
The applicability and use of the equations introduced are illustrated by computational results for the social self-organization of behavioral conventions.},

This model takes into account spontaneous (or externally induced) behavioral changes and behavioral changes by pair interactions. As most important social pair interactions, imitative and avoidance processes are distinguished. The resulting model turns out to include as special cases many theoretical concepts of the social sciences.

A Kramers-Moyal expansion of the Boltzmann-like equations leads to the Boltzmann- Fokker-Planck equations, which allows the introduction of â€œsocial forcesâ€� and â€œsocial fieldsâ€�. A social field reflects the influence of the public opinion, social norms and trends on behavioural changes. It is not only given by external factors (the environment) but also by the interactions of the individuals. Variations of the individual behavior are taken into account by diffusion coefficients.},

Our evaluations of video recordings show that the geometric boundary conditions are not only relevant for the capacity of the elements of pedestrian facilities, they also influence the time gap distribution of pedestrians, indicating the existence of self-organization phenomena. After calibration of suitable models, these findings can be used to improve design elements of pedestrian facilities and egress routes. It turns out that "obstacles" can stabilize flow patterns and make them more fluid. Moreover, intersecting flows can be optimized, utilizing the phenomenon of "stripe formation." We also suggest increasing diameters of egress routes in stadia, theaters, and lecture halls to avoid long waiting times for people in the back, and shock waves due to impatience in cases of emergency evacuation. Moreover, zigzag-shaped geometries and columns can reduce the pressure in panicking crowds. The proposed design solutions are expected to increase the efficiency and safety of train stations, airport terminals, stadia, theaters, public buildings, and mass events in the future. As application examples we mention the evacuation of passenger ships and the simulation of pilgrim streams on the Jamarat bridge. Adaptive escape guidance systems, optimal way systems, and simulations of urban pedestrian flows are addressed as well.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most disastrous forms of collective human behaviour is the kind of crowd stampede induced by panic, often leading to fatalities as people are crushed or trampled. Sometimes this behaviour is triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires in crowded buildings; at other times, stampedes can arise from the rush for seats or seemingly without causes. Tragic examples within recent months include the panics in Harare, Zimbabwe, and at the Roskilde rock concert in Denmark. Although engineers are finding ways to alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing with the number and size of mass events. Yet, systematic studies of panic behaviour, and quantitative theories capable of predicting such crowd dynamics, are rare. Here we show that simulations based on a model of pedestrian behaviour can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of and preconditions for panic and jamming by incoordination. Our results suggest practical ways of minimising the harmful consequences of such events and the existence of an optimal escape strategy, corresponding to a suitable mixture of individualistic and collective behaviour.},

We find that the empirically identified inefficiencies of the evacuation process can be well reproduced. Our particular focus is on the spatial dependence of the escape times on the initial positions, which is highly significant. The escape time distribution turns out to be rather broad due to a jamming (queuing) of the students at the exit, which determines not only the saturation flow (capacity) but also the temporal characteristics of the evacuation dynamics.},

Our analytical results for the transition to oscillatory pedestrian and traffic flows and the average waiting times are well supported by numerical evaluations and give a detailed picture of the collective dynamics emerging when pedestrians try to cross a road. The mathematical expressions allow one to identify the dependence on model parameters such as the vehicle or pedestrian arrival rate, and the safety factor of pedestrian gap acceptance. We also calculate a formula for the vehicle time gap distribution, which corresponds to the departure time contribution of a M / D / 1 queue characterized by Poissonian distributed Markovian arrivals, 1 service channel, and deterministic departures.},

For ethical reasons, however, there is a serious lack of experimental data regarding crowd panic. Therefore, we have analyzed video recordings of the crowd disaster in Mina/Makkah during the Hajj in 1426H on 12 January 2006. They reveal two subsequent, sudden transitions from laminar to stop-and-go and ''turbulent'' flows, which question many previous simulation models. While the transition from laminar to stop-and-go flows supports a recent model of bottleneck flows (D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 168001 (2006)), the subsequent transition to turbulent flow is not yet well understood. It is responsible for sudden eruptions of pressure release comparable to earthquakes, which cause sudden displacements and the falling and trampling of people. The insights of this study into the
reasons for critical crowd conditions are important for the organization of safer mass events. In particular, they allow one to understand where and when crowd accidents tend to occur. They have also led to organizational changes, which have ensured a safe Hajj in 1427H.},

If the inflow is below the maximum outflow, we find an asymptotic stationary solution. If the inflow is above this value, we observe queue formation, which can be described by a shock wave equation. We also address the experimental observation of intermittent outflows, taking into account the lack of space in the merging zone by a minimum function and coordination problems by a stochastic variable. This results in avalanches of different sizes even if friction, force networks, inelastic collapse, or delay-induced stop-and-go waves are not assumed. Our intermittent flows result from a random alternation between particle propagation and gap propagation. Erratic flows in congested merging zones of vehicle traffic may be explained in a similar way.},

Such models have previously been applied to the study of complex structure formation in physical14-16, chemical17 and biological18,19 systems. We find that our model is able to reproduce many of the observed large-scale spatial features of trail systems.},

These ''forces'' are not directly exerted by the pedestrians' personal environment, but they are a measure for the internal motivations of the individuals to perform certain actions (movements). The corresponding force concept is discussed in more detail and can also be applied to the description of other behaviors. In the presented model of pedestrian behavior several force terms are essential: first, a term describing the acceleration towards the desired velocity of motion; second, terms reflecting that a pedestrian keeps a certain distance from other pedestrians and borders; and third, a term modeling attractive effects. The resulting equations of motion of nonlinearly coupled Langevin equations. Computer simulations of crowds of interacting pedestrians show that the social force model is capable of describing the self-organization of several observed collective effects of pedestrian behavior very realistically.},

  Abstract                 = {Although pedestrians have individual preferences, aims, and destinations, the dynamics of pedestrian crowds is surprisingly predictable. Pedestrians can move freely only at small pedestrian densities. Otherwise their motion is affected by repulsive interactions with other pedestrians, giving rise to self-organization phenomena. Examples of the resulting patterns of motion are separate lanes of uniform walking direction in crowds of oppositely moving pedestrians or oscillations of the passing direction at bottlenecks. If pedestrians leave footprints on deformable ground (for example, in green spaces such as public parks) this additionally causes attractive interactions which are mediated by modifications of their environment. In such cases, systems of pedestrian trails will evolve over time. The corresponding computer simulations are a valuable tool for developing optimized pedestrian facilities and way systems.},

It is shown that they also allow one to simulate the formation of trail systems by pedestrians and ants, yielding a better understanding of human and animal behavior. A comparison with empirical material shows a good agreement between model and reality. Our trail formation model includes an equation of motion, an equation for environmental changes, and an orientation relation. It contains some model functions, which are specified according to the characteristics of the considered animals or pedestrians. Not only the kind of environmental changes differs: Whereas pedestrians leave footprints on the ground, ants produce chemical markings for their orientation. Nevertheless, it is more important that pedestrians steer towards a certain destination, while ants usually find their food sources by chance, i.e., they reach their destination in a stochastic way. As a consequence, the typical structure of the evolving trail systems depends on the respective species. Some ant species produce a dendritic trail system, whereas pedestrians generate a minimal detour system. The trail formation model can be used as a tool for the optimization of pedestrian facilities: It allows urban planners to design convenient way systems which actually meet the route choice habits of pedestrians.},

The main focus of our work was on designing and engineering an algorithm that is completely reliable and fast in practice. The algorithm was implemented in ANSIÂ C, using standard floating-point arithmetic. In addition to Sugihara and Iri's topology-oriented approach, it is based on a very careful implementation of the numerical computations required, an automatic relaxation of epsilon thresholds, and a multi-level recovery process combined with â€œdesperate modeâ€�. The resulting code, named vroni , was tested extensively on real-world data and turned out to be reliable. CPU-time statistics document that it is always faster than other popular Voronoi codes. In our computing environment, vroni needs about 0.01nlog2n milliseconds to compute the Voronoi diagram of n line segments, and this formula holds for a wide variety of synthetic and real-world data. In particular, its CPU-time consumption is hardly affected by the actual distribution of the input data. Vroni also features a function for computing offset curves, and it has been successfully tested within and integrated into several industrial software packages. },

Current models take into account the physical contact forces occurring in a crowd, but the description of many behavioural actions is still a challenge. This paper presents a model for agentsâ€™ behaviour in counterflow situations, where they try to avoid collisions with oncoming agents. In the model, the agents observe the walking directions of the agents in front of them and choose their own actions accordingly. We implement the model to the widely used social force model, which describes the motion of each agent in a Newtonian manner. Nevertheless, the basic idea of the counterflow model can be used with various modelling platforms. We study the effects of the modelâ€™s parameters with Monte Carlo simulations and justify our selection of their values. Simulation results are compared with previously published experimental data and the results match well.},

Our results suggest that the members of an evacuating crowd may not be able to make optimal decisions when assessing the fastest exit to evacuate. In addition, the egress time of the whole crowd turns out to be shorter when the evacuees behave egoistically instead of behaving cooperatively. This is an interesting result because many studies on real emergencies show that evacuees tend to cooperate and act altruistically.},

  Abstract                 = {In an earlier paper data were presented on the speed/velocity probability density distributions measured for three human crowds. Ideally all the people in any crowd would have about the same mass and the same probability of having given velocity components and we considered that the three crowds studied - university students, pedestrians on a zebra crossing, and 6-8 year old children in a school playground - were homogeneous with males and females present in about equal numbers. Observations were carried out in 1965-1966 on more than 2,000 people (Table 1). The measured distributions agreed reasonably well with the theoretical distributions obtained from a Maxwell-Boltzmann theory, except near the maximum of each distribution where a significant deviation occurred. The measured distributions all displayed a bimodal character which was tentatively attributed to sexual inhomogeneity among the people. This led to the hypothesis that males and females behaved as though they belonged to different populations in an otherwise homogeneous crowd. The effect was not anticipated during the planning of the observations and the data on the differences between the sexes were not complete enough to test the hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Due, perhaps, to the historical division of crowd dynamics research into psychological and engineering approaches, microscopic crowd models have tended toward modelling simple interchangeable particles with an emphasis on the simulation of physical factors. Despite the fact that people have complex (non-panic) behaviours in crowd disasters, important human factors in crowd dynamics such as information discovery and processing, changing goals and communication have not yet been well integrated at the microscopic level. We use our Microscopic Human Factors methodology to fuse a microscopic simulation of these human factors with a popular microscopic crowd model. By tightly integrating human factors with the existing model we can study the effects on the physical domain (movement, force and crowd safety) when human behaviour (information processing and communication) is introduced.

In a large-room egress scenario with ample exits, information discovery and processing yields a crowd of non-interchangeable individuals who, despite close proximity, have different goals due to their different beliefs. This crowd heterogeneity leads to complex inter-particle interactions such as jamming transitions in open space; at high crowd energies, we found a freezing by heating effect (reminiscent of the disaster at Central Lenin Stadium in 1982) in which a barrier formation of naÃ¯ve individuals trying to reach blocked exits prevented knowledgeable ones from exiting. Communication, when introduced, reduced this barrier formation, increasing both exit rates and crowd safety.},

  Abstract                 = {Granular materials, like sand, powder or grains present intriguing phenomena. Vibration and shearing can lead to convective motion and segregation. A variation of stress may cause localization phenomena like stress chains or shear bands. Granular systems are thus in a state far from thermodynamic equilibrium, however, we present an attempt for a thermodynamic description by extending the concept of compactivity. In vibrating containers under the influence of gravity, the granular material shows a peculiar density profile. In the weak dissipation / strong agitation limit the density decays exponentially with height, whereas one observes an almost uniform profile in the case of strong dissipation / weak agitation. In the latter regime, the formation of convection cells due to walls or amplitude modulations can be observed. The onset of fluidization can be determined and is in good agreement with experiments. Connected to convection is the effect of rapid segregation, however, comparatively slow segregation can also be observed in the absence of convection. Numerical simulations of flow in hoppers show that the density fluctuations have a power spectrum, allowing for large Ã¢Â€ÂœeventsÃ¢Â€Â� with finite probability. There is also ample experimental and numerical evidence showing the existence of spontaneous density patterns in granular material flowing through pipes or hoppers. Due to fluctuations of the wall friction, shock waves are created and arches are formed, slowing down the material which follows. In regions of anisotropic stress, the rotational degree of freedom is frustrated parallel to strong stresses, so that ordering akin to anti-ferromagnetic spin coupling may be observed. Pouring two different materials on a flat surface leads to a sandpile with stratification patterns. The mechanisms leading to this segregation of the two types are examined with experiments and numerical simulations. The stress distribution inside a sandpile depends strongly on the contact network. A relatively small polydispersity causes a reorganization of the contact network and leads to the so called stress chains, i.e. the stress at neighboring particles may vary dramatically. Finally, the plastic shear bands occuring in large scale deformations of compactified granular media are investigated by using an explicit Lagrangian technique as well as molecular dynamics simulations with non-spherical particles.},

  Abstract                 = {One focus of recent research activities in the field of pedestrian dynamics simulation is the evaluation of commonly used dynamics models: The data output of computer simulations is compared to empirical data gained from observation of real-life pedestrian behavior. For this, simple scenarios such as bottlenecks or corridors with bi-directional pedestrian streams were arranged with human test subjects and then computer-simulated accordingly. When the same scenarios were simulated by a number of common simulation tools, significant deviations between the data generated by the different applications were found, concerning e.g. the calculated evacuation time for a simple building.
These findings lead to the conclusion that established models will have to be reevaluated by comparing their output with empirical data and if necessary adapted in a way to make them more realistic. Only then it will be possible to draw reliable conclusions for real-life pedestrian traffic flow.
This article presents and analyzes genetic algorithms that can be used to adjust parameters of the Social Force model using empirical pedestrian traffic data with the objective of simulating pedestrian dynamics in the closest possible accordance to reality.},

  Abstract                 = {Für die Planung von Rettungswegen stehen dem Ingenieur unterschiedliche Werkzeuge, wie Richtlinien, Handbücher oder Computersimulationen, zur Ver-fügung. Eine kritische Analyse des aktuellen Stands der Technik zeigt aller-dings, dass die mit diesen Verfahren ermittelten Rettungswegebreiten und -längen mit erheblichen Unsicherheiten behaftet sind. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass auch die baurechtlichen Anforderungen der eu-ropäischen Länder signifikante Unterschiede bei der Vorgabe für die Mindest-breite von Rettungswegen aufweisen [1]. Ein Vergleich verschiedener Pro-gramme zur Simulation von Gebäuderäumungen ergibt ein ähnliches Bild [2]. Ursache dieser Unsicherheiten ist, dass die wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen, insbesondere die experimentelle Datenbasis für die Bewegung von Personen-strömen, unzureichend und widersprüchlich sind [3]. Dies liegt unter anderem an der Komplexität von Personenströmen, aber auch an der Vielfältigkeit der Anlagentypen, auf denen sich Fußgänger bewegen.
Der vorliegende Beitrag konzentriert sich auf die empirischen Grundlagen für die Bemessung der Rettungswegbreite. In Gebäuden mit großen Personenzah-len, wie Stadien, Schulen oder Bahnhöfen, kann diese einen wesentlichen Ein-fluss auf die Räumungszeit haben. Es werden die gesetzlichen Vorgaben und Handrechenverfahren beleuchtet und experimentellen Daten gegenübergestellt. Die hierbei deutlich werdenden Widersprüche werden durch Ergebnisse eigener Experimente aufgelöst.},

The theory asserts that pedestrians predict the behavior of other pedestrians based on their observations and the assumed walking strategies of nearby pedestrians. The approach yields closed-form mathematical expressions predicting the acceleration and directional change of a pedestrian.

  Abstract                 = {The level-of-services in public walking spaces such as transfer stations, shopping malls, airports, etc., are largely determined by the differences in pedestrian traffic demand and infrastructure supply. For designers, insight into the capacity of a bottleneck is therefore very important. It is generally assumed that bottleneck capacity depends linearly of the effective width of the bottleneck. This paper shows that this is not true due to the way pedestrians use the available bottleneck space.
To study walking behavior in bottlenecks, walking experiments were conducted. The experiments show that the pedestrians inside the bottleneck self-organize and form dynamic lanes. The speeds of these overlapping lanes are equal, but the longitudinal positions of the pedestrians in adjacent lanes are largely independent, within the bounds of physical restrictions. Their constrained headway (empty zone) distributions are independent of the considered situation (narrow bottleneck, wide bottleneck), as well as the lateral distances
between the dynamic lanes. The former is studied by estimating composite headway models (Semi-Poisson model of Buckley), which turn out to be applicable to pedestrian flows.
The lateral distance between the lanes is much less than the shoulder width of a pedestrian, due to what is referred to as the zipper effect. This effect causes the capacity of the bottleneck to increase in a step-wise fashion, rather than linearly with the width of the bottleneck.},

Additionally, management of pedestrian flows requires knowledge of pedestrian flow behavior. This paper puts forward a microscopic pedestrian flow model. In the model, pedestrians of different types (age, gender, travel purpose, experience) are randomly generated at origin areas. Pedestrians walk from their current location to the destination area, while minimizing a cost function, expressing for instance the travel time and cost incurred by walking too close to obstacles or walls. On the contrary to discrete choice analysis, the number of choice options the pedestrian has is nearly infinite. To correctly describe pedestrian wayfinding, the choice problem is formulated as an optimal control problem, aimed at finding the path which optimises the trip utility. On the tactical and operational pedestrian behaviour levels, the model is characterized by non-local stimulusresponse mechanisms describing pedestrian anticipation and interaction behavior. Moreover, local route choice behavior is included, describing how pedestrians choose their direction based on among other things their destination, and local pedestrian flow conditions. This local choice behavior is based on the concept of subjective utility maximization. Moreover, the model features parallel updating. The model can describe multi-directional pedestrian flows (e.g. uni-directional, bi-directional, crossing flows). This paper discusses application of the model to a number of test-case scenarios. We discuss model properties such as the dependence of the speed-density relation on pedestrian composition, and self-formation of lanes in case of bi-directional pedestrian flows. Moreover, differences in pedestrian wayfinding for inexperienced and experienced pedestrians, and the consequent differences in flow operations are discussed. It turns out that the location of congestion depends on the experience of pedestrians},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a dynamic mixed discrete-continuous choice approach to modeling pedestrian travel and activity choice behavior in public facilities. The approach views revealed behavior as a manifestation of pedestrians' preferences by assuming that pedestrians choose the alternative that maximizes expected (subjective) utility, while taking into account the uncertainty in expected traffic conditions. The choice dimensions are trajectories between origin and subsequent destinations, areas where activities are performed (multiple vs. fixed destination), execution of discretionary activities, and finally activities completion times and order.
The disutility of a trajectory determines the trajectory choice of the traveler. Destination area choice is included in the modeling by determining time-dependent and destination-specific arrival costs. Furthermore, penalties for not executing a planned activity are introduced into the modeling framework. The resulting modeling approach has a clear analogy with stochastic control theory and dynamic programming in continuous time and space.
The main innovations presented here is the relaxation of the assumption that routes are discrete sets of travel links. The approach relaxes the need to build a discrete network, while routes (trajectories) are continuous functions in time and space. At the same time, destination choice is included in the modeling framework.},

Compared to other modes of transport, a characteristic feature of pedestrian route choice is that routes are continuous trajectories in time and space: since a pedestrian chooses a route from an infinite set of alternatives, dedicated theories and models describing pedestrian route choice are required.
This article puts forward a new theory of pedestrian behavior under uncertainty based on the concept of utility maximization. The main behavioral assumption is that pedestrians optimize some predicted pedestrian-specific utility function, representing a trade-off between the utility gained from performing activities at a specific location, and the predicted cost of walking subject to the physical limitations of the pedestrians and the kinematics of the pedestrian. The uncertainty reflects the randomness of the experienced traffic conditions.
Based on this normative theory, route choice, activity area choice, and activity scheduling are simultaneously optimized using dynamic programming for different traffic conditions and uncertainty levels. Throughout the article, the concepts are illustrated by examples.},

The model is characterized by pedestrian interaction behavior, based on stimulus-response mechanisms. Moreover, local route-choice behavior is included, which describes how pedestrians choose their direction on the basis of, among other things, their destination and local pedestrian flow conditions. The choice behavior is based on the concept of subjective utility maximization. Moreover, the model features parallel updating, comparable with recently developed cellular automata models for pedestrian flows. However, contrary to these models, pedestrian locations are not bounded to discrete cells. The model can therefore easily describe multidirectional pedestrian flows (e.g., unidirectional, bidirectional, and crossing). Application of the model to a simple hallway is discussed. Besides speed-density relations, self-organizing phenomena are studied in pedestrian flows (dynamic lane formation and clustering) from the microscopic pedestrian flow model.},

In this respect, managing traffic in congested networks requires a clear understanding of traffic flow operations; i.e. insights into what causes congestion, what determines the time and location of traffic breakdown, how does the congestion propagate through the network, etc., are essential. For this purpose, during the past fifty years, a wide range of traffic flow theories and models have been developed to answer these research questions. This paper presents an overview of some fifty years of modelling vehicular traffic flow. A rich variety of modelling approaches developed so far and in use today will be discussed and compared.

Lack of empirical knowledge regarding the characteristics of pedestrian flows under varying circumstances and designs motivates using a model-based approach. In this study, a new pedestrian flow model based on the gaskinetic modeling paradigm is established. The mesoscopic equations describe the dynamics of so-called pedestrian phase-space density, which can be considered as a two-dimensional generalization of the phase-space density used in gas-kinetic vehicular traffic flow. Convection, acceleration, and noncontinuum transition terms govern the dynamics. The latter terms reflect the dynamic influence of pedestrians decelerating and the changing angle of movement due to pedestrians interacting. Numerical solutions of the resulting gas-kinetic equations are established by using a novel particle discretization approach. Essentially, this approach upgrades the mesoscopic equations to a microscopic pedestrian flow simulation model. Using the particle discretization approach, the model's behavior is tested for different test-case scenarios. The model is shown to produce plausible speed-density functions from which walking speeds and travel times can be derived for a variety of conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Microscopic simulation models predict different forms of selforganization in pedestrian flows, such as the dynamic formation of lanes in bi-directional pedestrian flows. This paper proposes a theory predicting selforganization, as well as results from experimental research that provides more insight into these dynamic phenomena. Groups of pedestrians that are homogeneous in terms of desired walking speeds and direction appear to form structures consisting of overlapping layers. This basic pattern forms the basis of other more complex patterns emerging in multi-directional pedestrian
flow: in a bi-directional pedestrian flow, dynamic lanes are formed which can be described by the layer structure. Diagonal patterns can be identified in crossing pedestrian flows. This paper both describes these structures, as well as the implications for theory and modeling of pedestrian flows.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on the calibration of microscopic pedestrian models using pedestrian trajectory data. A generic approach is proposed that enables parameter identification for microscopic models in general and in particular for walker models. The application results provide new insight into the behavior of individual pedestrians, interpedestrian differences, as well as the resulting pedestrian flow characteristics. By comparing different models of increasing complexity, it is investigated which of the model amendments are significant from a statistical point of view. It is shown that besides anisotropy, finite reaction times play an important role in correctly describing microscopic walking behavior. The implications of these findings in the microscopic description of pedestrian flows are considered by studying the predicted flow operations at a narrow bottleneck. It turns out that the finite reaction times have a significant effect on the pedestrian flow operations, and should hence be included in pedestrian models to ensure realistic predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {Traffic operations in public walking spaces are to a large extent determined by differences in pedestrian traffic demand and infrastructure supply. Congestion occurs when pedestrian traffic demand exceeds the capacity. In turn, the latter is determined by a number of factors, such as the width of the bottleneck and the wall surface, as well as the interaction behavior of the pedestrians passing the bottleneck.
This article discusses experimental findings of microscopic pedestrian behavior in case of bottlenecks. Results for both a narrow bottleneck and a wide bottleneck are discussed and compared to the results of an experiment without a bottleneck. It is shown how pedestrians inside bottlenecks effectively form layers or trails, the distance between which is approximately 45 cm. This is less than the effective width of a single pedestrian, which is around 55 cm. The layers are thus overlapping, a phenomenon which is referred to as the 'zipper' effect. The pedestrians within these layers follow each other at 1.3 seconds, irrespective of the considered experiment. For the narrow bottleneck case (width of one meter) two layers are formed; for the wide bottleneck case (width of two meters), four or five layers are formed, although the life span of these layers is rather small.
The zipper effect causes the capacity of the bottleneck to increase in a stepwise fashion with the width of the bottleneck, at least for bottlenecks of moderate width (less than 3 m). This has substantial implications for the design of walking facilities.},

  Abstract                 = {Insight into walking behavior is essential for theory and model development describing the behavior of individual pedestrians. In turn, microscopic pedestrian simulation models can be used to test and compare different infrastructure designs, both from the perspective of efficiency and safety. To calibrate these microscopic models, detailed data is required. However, currently such data is not available. 
This paper discusses an approach to extract individual pedestrian data from digital video footage. In this specific case, the footage was collected during a large scale walking experiment performed at the Delft University of Technology. In this experiment, a group of approximately 80 pedestrians conducted different tests, while being observed using a video camera mounted at the ceiling of the hall.
In the first phase of the pedestrian tracking process, different image processing operations, such as radiometric correction and correction for lens distortion are applied. Next, the pedestrians are detected by identifying the special colored caps the pedestrians were wearing during the experiment. This detection occurs in a special zone where conditions are such that pedestrian detection is optimal. Next, pedestrian tracking is achieved by application of a newly developed tracking technique. This is achieved by minimizing the so-called merit-function. A Kalman filter is applied to reduce the errors made during tracking. The paper concludes by showing some of the tracking results, and accuracy estimates. It turns out that the pedestrian trajectories can be determined with high accuracy. Also, some interesting findings pertaining to the behavior of pedestrians are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses assessment of station designs by application of pedestrian flow simulation models. In particular, station design issues pertain to the way access gates will effect the pedestrian flow operations, regarding levels-of-service, congestion levels, average walking times, delays incurred at the gates, etc. Furthermore, the effects of different system layouts are studied, as well as the difference between different gate systems (low and high capacity systems) in terms of processing passenger flows. Finally, we are interested in pedestrian flow operations in case of emergency situations. To answer these questions, pedestrian traffic operations for different station design alternatives are predicted using the dynamic microscopic pedestrian flow model NOMAD. This is done for reference situations (validation), as well as for the design alternatives. The NOMAD model has been extended with a new module describing pedestrian operations (i.e. user-optimal gate choice) at the gates. It turned out that the simple design guidelines used to set-up the design alternatives provided satisfactory level-of-service to the transferring pedestrians, and that the gates could be installed without compromising passenger safety. Nevertheless, the need to re-route, inefficient gate use and interactions between conflicting pedestrians flows caused small but significant delays to transferring pedestrians, that could not have been predicted without the use of an adequate micro simulation model.},

The study covers aspects of crowd behaviour, observational findings and issues that must be considered when accommodating crowds. It provides an overview of the features stadia use to protect stadium patrons from fire, and a brief history of some famous stadium incidents and their contribution to the profile of the modern stadium. 
In 2001 there were two major mass casualty fire disasters in highly populated buildings in the USA. Subsequently there has been increased attention ed on the vulnerability of high profile sites and gathering places to large-scale mass casualty events. Effective mitigation in such variable populations is two-part: evacuation and protection of the populous.
New Zealand (NZ) does not have work-place buildings of the scale of those in other developed countries such as the USA. The largest capacity structures in New Zealand are entertainment venues, namely stadia. In 2002 New Zealand had ten operational large stadia with the capacity to accommodate in excess of 20,000 patrons. The NZ Fire Service has attended 28 call outs to these stadia over the last 3.5 years. Three of these call-outs were to attend actual fires. By identifying issues particular to stadia evacuations (structural and management practice) it is hoped gain insight as to how to prevent New Zealand stadia from entering the international list of major mass casualty case studies.},

  Abstract                 = {In fire safety engineering, the performance based design concept relies strongly on the use of computer simulations of fire and evacuation processes. The validation of the simulation tools requires experimental information on the human behaviour during the evacuation situations. In this work, two different types of evacuation situations were studied. The first type was evacuation drills which are normally carried out as part of the safety training of the staff in public buildings and workplaces. The advantage of evacuation drills is that the building (and, if necessary, also the occupants) can be equipped with monitoring devices in order to observe the events during the evacuation. The drawback of the evacuation drills is that the building occupants are normally informed beforehand which may affect the decision making processes. The second type was actual evacuations which occur every now and then. The advantage of actual evacuations is that the decision making processes are likely to be similar to what they would be in case of a real fire.
The main techniques used for the observation of evacuation drills were video cameras and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Both techniques were used in the evacuation drills in a public library and two office buildings. A large amount of information was obtained and the problems in the application of the observation techniques were identified. In particular, the results show that when the RFID technique is used, the placement of the antennas and tags is very important. With careful placement of the antennas and tags, the reliability of the RFID technique as applied in the current work may be sufficient for scientific purposes. The reliability is poor if the tags are placed under the clothing of other absorbing material.
In the observation of an actual evacuation of a large shopping centre, the recordings of the surveillance cameras were used to measure the flow rates of people. The results are very promising and indicate that the collection of surveillance camera recordings from large evacuations should be started.},

The modifications lie in developing a method to calculate the static floor field for every lattice site, which is determined by the most feasible distance to an exit, and employing a logit-based discrete choice principle to govern the exit selection. Simulation results show that the evacuation time is sensitive to the exit position and some model parameters. For pedestrians unfamiliar with the exit location, additional doors may not be necessary and can cause a negative effect on evacuation time. It is also found that unfamiliarity with the room's inner configuration and blindly following others will lead to an increase of the evacuation time.},

  Abstract                 = {In speeding-up normal walking, relative phase between horizontal thorax and pelvis rotations changes from more in-phase (synchronous) to more out-of-phase. In pathology (stroke, Parkinson's disease, low-back pain, pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain), this often fails to happen. Even in healthy gait, however, these phenomena remain poorly understood. Thoraxâ€“pelvis relative phase may increase with either stride length, or stride frequency. Sixteen healthy male subjects walked on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, or 1.5 m/s, with small, normal, or large steps. Increasing stride length (with lower frequency) led to larger spinal rotations, larger thoraxâ€“pelvis relative phase, and lower pelvisâ€“leg relative phase, while the thorax continued to counterrotate with respect to the leg. With small steps, speeding-up hardly affected thoraxâ€“pelvis relative phase, and spinal amplitudes remained low. From a certain walking speed onwards, pelvis rotations start to contribute to stride length, and thus to speed (the â€œpelvic stepâ€�). This phenomenon appears to be driven, and the present study suggests, at least for higher speeds, that also thoracic counterrotations are driven, and not determined by the passive dynamics of the system. For patients, several strategies may exist to avoid large thoraxâ€“pelvis relative phase, and the concomitant large rotations of the spine: walking slowly, walking with small steps, adapting the timing of thorax rotations to that of the pelvis, or refraining from adapting the timing of pelvis rotations to the movements of the leg. },

Reproducing these experimental observations using a non-spatial model suggests that spatial geometry may have less of an impact on collective motion than previously thought.},

  Abstract                 = {The equations of motion governing the two-dimensional flow of pedestrians are derived for flows of both single and multiple pedestrian types. Two regimes of flow, a high-density (subcritical) and a low-density (supercritical) flow regimes, are possible, rather than two flow regimes for each type of pedestrian. A subcritical flow always fills the space available. However, a supercritical flow may either fill the space available or be self-confining for each type of pedestrian, depending on the boundary location. Although, the equations governing these flows are simultaneous, time-dependent, non-linear, partial differential equations, remarkably they may be made conformally mappable. The solution of these equations becomes trivial in many situations. Free streamline calculations, utilizing this property, reveal both upstream and downstream separation of the flow of pedestrians around an obstacle. Such analysis tells much about the nature of the assumptions used in various models for the flow of pedestrians. The present theory is designed for the development of general techniques to understand the motion of large crowds. However, it is also useful as a predictive tool. The behavior predicted by these equations of motion is compared with aerial observations for the Jamarat Bridge near Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is shown that, for this important case, pedestrians, that is pilgrims, aim at achieving each immediate goal in minimum time rather than achieving all goals in overall minimum time. Typical of many examples, this case illustrated the strong dependence of path on the psychological state of the pedestrians involved. It is proposed that the flow of pedestrians over the Jamarat Bridge be improved by appropriate barrier placement, that force an effective global view of the goals.},

to problems including perspective, occlusion, clutter, and

images is almost impossible. Instead, our approach relies
on low confidence head detections, repetition of texture ele-

pute several maps which indicate the confidence in observ-
ing individuals in an image region. Secondly, we employ a
global consistency constraint on spatial and multi-scale in-
dividual counts using Markov Random Field, which caters
for disparity in counts in local neighborhoods arising from
perspective distortion. We tested our approach on a new
dataset of fifty crowd images containing 64K annotated hu-
mans, with the head counts ranging from 94 to 4543. This
is in stark contrast to datasets used for existing methods
which contain not more than tens of individuals. We experi-
mentally demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the pro-

  Abstract                 = {For the past 35 years, the investigators now working in the Biomechanics Laboratory have
been gathering data on normal and abnormal human walking. A great amount of information
has been accumulated with the use of many varied techniques.
The early studies (1944-1947) dea lt with fundamental aspects of human walking. particularl y
in relation to problems faced by lower limb amputees. A number of tec hniques , either new or
refined , were used in these studies, including motion pictures, force plates, interrupted lights.
inserted pins, glass walkways, and electromyography. These ea rly s tudies were described in the
first finished work in a se ries of technical reports (Fundame ntal Studies, 1947). This two-volume
report contains an ex tensi ve annotated bibliography of studies of human walking dating from
the earliest times.
Later investigations included studies of the dynamics of human locomotion, of the energy
expe nditure of normal and disabled persons, and of the effects of immobilization of joints on
energy expenditure, as well as a clinical eva luation of expe rim ental orthotic devices. The
unders tanding of the mechanics of human walking was greatly expa nded by quantitative
measurements of normal gait, which ha ve also been used as a basis for describing, comparing,
and evaluating how a handicapped person '·typically" compensates for defects during walking.
Other s tudi es dealt with rotations of the spine, relative roles of gravitational and inertial work
in the ene rgy cost and cha ra cter of human walking, dynamic relationships between various
segme nts of the human body, and electromyographic recordings of activity of the muscles of the
back and limbs during walking.
Unfortunately, for various reasons, much of the acquired information has till now not been
pub lished in readily accessible form. The major part appeared in the previously mentioned
seri es of tec hni cal reports, which were not widely distributed and most of which are now out of
print. It was , th erefore , decided to write a comprehens ive monograph on human walking, which
would su mmarize the knowledge acquired by in vestiga tors at the Biomechanics Laboratory.
The book starts with a qualitative description of the displacements in the three planes of
space of the various co mponents of the skeletal system. The intent is to provide an overall view
of human walking.
Chapter 2, on kinematics, begins with a defi nition of the basic req uirements of walking: (1)
co ntinuous sup port against gravity and (2) alternating periodic motion of the lower limbs. Stride
and step dimensions and phases of the walking cycle are defined. Typical walking speeds are
give n, followed by a detailed prese ntation of displacements and segme nt rotations in the side,
fro nt or rear, and top or bottom views.
Metabolic energy req uiremen ts are discussed in Chapter 3. After a sta tement of the units used,
a short presentation of energy expenditures during lying, sitting, and standing is made for
pur poses of compa riso n. The relation between energy expe nditures and speed during level
wa lking is nex t di scussed, followed by data on th e energy expen ded per unit distance walked.
The effects of slope-walking, stair-climbing, and variables of load, restraint , and terrain are
considered. Finally, th ere is a discussion of work , power, and efficie ncy during walking.
Chapter 4, on kinetics , discusses the forces involved in human walking. Data are prese nted on
joint moments, joint power, and mechanical e nergy levels of the different parts of the body.
Muscles supply the force to achieve the angular displacements involved in walking, and their
characteristics and action are considered in Chapter 5. After a description of the functional
characteristics of striated muscle, the skeletal mechanisms and changes in joint moments that
permit the muscles to operate at their most effective lengths ace presented. In conclusion, the
phasic action of the individual muscle groups during walking is discussed, with emphasis on
electromyographic data.
There follows (Chapter 6) a discussion of the implications of the previously presented findings,
with special emphasis on orthopaedic conditions. A final chapter deals with the biomechanical
principles underlying prosthetics.},

People in a dark or smoky room are mimicked by "blind" students wearing eye masks. The evacuation of the disoriented students from the room is observed by video cameras, and the escape time of each student is measured. We find that the disoriented students exhibit a distinctly different behavior compared to a situation in which people can see their environment. Our experimental results are related to a theoretical approach and reproduced by an extended lattice gas model taking into account the empirically observed behavior. Our particular focus is on the mean value and distribution of escape times. For a large number of people in the room, the escape time distribution is wide because of jamming. Surprisingly, adding more exits does not improve the situation in the expected way, since most people use the exit that is discovered first, which may be viewed as a kind of herding effect based on nonlocal, but direct acoustic interactions. Moreover, the average escape time becomes minimal for a certain finite number of people in the dark or smoky room. These nonlinear effects have practical implications for emergency evacuation and the planning of safer buildings.},

  Abstract                 = {Many models have been developed to provide designers with methods for forecasting the time required for evacuation from various places under a variety of conditions. Particularly for high traffic buildings or buildings of cultural, governmental, or industrial importance, it is of paramount importance to properly evaluate and plan for the necessary evacuation time. To address this need, a number of models for pedestrian simulation, either considering the system as a whole or studying the behavior and decisions of individual pedestrians and their interactions with other pedestrians, have been developed over the years. In this work, a model for evacuation simulation and for estimating evacuation times is proposed. It is inspired by the so-called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The multi-agent-based simulation characteristics of PSO and the way this technique combines individual and collective intelligence make it suitable for this problem. The PSO-based model presented here allows for assessment of the behavioral patterns followed by individuals during a rapid evacuation event. Evaluation of these behaviors can address a variety of public safety concerns, such as architectural design, evacuation protocol definition, and regulation of public space.},

Compared to the original method, our solution is well-suited for complex environments. First, we present an environmental structure and a corresponding discretization scheme that helps us to organize and simulate crowds in large-scale scenarios. Second, additional discomfort zones around obstacles are auto-generated to keep a certain, psychologically plausible distance between pedestrians and obstacles, making it easier to obtain smoother trajectories when people move around these obstacles. Third, we propose a technique for density conversion; the density field is dynamically affected by each individual so that it can be adapted to different grid resolutions. The experiment results demonstrate that our hybrid solution can perform plausible crowd flow simulations in complex dynamic environments.},

The fundamental diagram of mixed pedestrian flow is also investigated and the dependence of the flow rate on the ratio of fast pedestrians is simulated. Finally, the counter flow of mixed pedestrians is studied and it is found the more homogeneous the mixed pedestrians are distributed, the smaller the jam transition threshold is.},

The desired directional motion of pedestrians is determined by an Eikonal-type equation, which describes a problem that minimizes the instantaneous total walking cost from origin to destination. A linear stability analysis of the model demonstrates that its ability to describe traffic instability in crowd flows. The algorithm to solve the macroscopic model is composed of a splitting technique introduced to treat the relaxation terms, a second-order positivity preserving central-upwind scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws, and a fast sweeping method for the Eikonal-type equation on unstructured meshes. To test applicability of the model, we study a challenging pedestrian crowd flow problem of the presence of an obstruction in a two-dimensional continuous walking facility. The numerical results indicate the rationality of the model and the effectiveness of the computational algorithm in predicting the flux or density distribution and the macroscopic behavior of the pedestrian crowd flow. The simulation results are compared with those obtained by the two-dimensional Lighthill-Whitham-Richards pedestrian flow model with various model parameters, which further shows that the macroscopic model is able to correctly describe complex phenomena such as "stop-and-go waves" observed in empirical pedestrian flows.},

There is a large variety in flow and speed as functions of density for empirical data of pedestrian streams obtained from studies in different countries. The net-time headway, however, stays approximately constant over all these different data sets. By using this fact, we demonstrate how the underlying dynamics of pedestrian crowds, naturally follows from local interactions. This means that there is no need to
come up with an arbitrary fit function (with arbitrary fit parameters) as has traditionally been done. Further, by using not only the average density values but the variance as well, we show how the recently reported stop-and-go waves [Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. E 75, 046109 (2007)] emerge when local density variations take values exceeding a certain maximum global (average) density, which makes pedestrians stop.},

  Abstract                 = {The study of crowd dynamics is interesting because of the various self-organization phenomena resulting from the interactions of many pedestrians, which may improve or obstruct their flow. Besides formation of lanes of uniform walking direction and oscillations at bottlenecks at moderate densities, it was recently discovered that stop-and-go waves [D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 (2006) 168001] and a phenomenon called "crowd turbulence" can occur at high pedestrian densities [D. Helbing et al., Phys. Rev. E 75 (2007) 046109]. Although the behavior of pedestrian crowds under extreme conditions is decisive for the safety of crowds during the access to or egress from mass events as well as for situations of emergency evacuation, there is still a lack of empirical studies of extreme crowding. Therefore, this paper discusses how one may study high-density conditions based on suitable video data. This is illustrated at the example of pilgrim flows entering the previous Jamarat Bridge in Mina, 5 kilometers from the Holy Mosque in Makkah, Saudi-Arabia. Our results reveal previously unexpected pattern formation phenomena and show that the average individual speed does not go to zero even at local densities of 10 persons per square meter. Since the maximum density and flow are different from measurements in other countries, this has implications for the capacity assessment and dimensioning of facilities for mass events. When conditions become congested, the flow drops significantly, which can cause stop-and-go waves and a further increase of the density until critical crowd conditions are reached. Then, "crowd turbulence" sets in, which may trigger crowd disasters. For this reason, it is important to operate pedestrian facilities sufficiently below their maximum capacity and to take measures to improve crowd safety, some of which are discussed in the end.},

  Abstract                 = {At the starting point of the work leading to this doctoral thesis, in January 2005, the work on pedestrians was almost exclusively oriented towards computer simulations and on evacuation experiments. Since then, there have been many studies on new methods for extracting empirical data of pedestrian movements (mainly based on video analysis,
lasers, and infrared cameras), but most of the work is still focused on artificial setups for crowds moving through corridors and crowds passing bottlenecks. Even though these controlled experiments are important to understand crowd dynamics, there is a knowledge gap between these experiments and the understanding of the dynamics leading to and occurring during large crowd disasters, when sometimes hundreds of thousands or even millions of pedestrians are involved.
Numerous crowd disasters occur every year at large gatherings around the world. Unfortunately, the information about the (spatio-temporal) development of these events tend to be qualitative rather than quantitative.
Video recordings from the crowd disaster in Mina, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on the 12th of January 2006, where hundreds of pilgrims lost their lives during the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah, gave the possibility to scientifically evaluate the dynamics of the crowd. With this video material, it was possible to observe and analyze the behavior of the crowd under increasing crowd density, leading to the disaster. Based on the insights from the analysis of the crowd disaster described above, new tools and measures to detect and avoid critical crowd conditions have been proposed, and some of them have been implemented in order to reduce the likelihood of similar disasters in the future.
Further contributions of this thesis are to empirically evaluate many of the previous assumptions used for pedestrian simulations. These assumptions are:
1. A pedestrian avoids collisions by changing her or his walking speed by an acceleration which is exponentially decaying with the distance to the pedestrian or object being avoided.
2. A pedestrian reacts stronger to what happens in front of her or him, than to what happens behind the back. 
3. The movement of a crowd of pedestrians always follows a smooth flow-density relationship, called the fundamental diagram.
4. The walking speed will settle at 0 m/s at a specific maximum crowd density. 
The first two assumptions were found to be consistent with the data, but the pedestrian-flow theory had to be revised, since the two latter assumptions do not always hold.
When these fundamental parts of pedestrian motion and avoiding maneuvers had been investigated, an improved version of the social-force-model [53, 57] was formulated.
In order to enable the revision of previous works and the analysis of the crowd disaster mentioned above, algorithms used for video-tracking have been introduced. The novelty
of this work concerns the uniqueness and quantity of data on which the algorithms are validated and calibrated, but also the focus on analyzing millions of pedestrians rather
than hundreds.
The aim of this thesis is to move from theoretical models and controlled lab conditions to applicable models for real-world conditions.},

This is conducted by examining the impact of population size and exit access width on crowd walking and crawling speeds on a flat surface. The findings of the study suggest that exit access width has a significant impact, whereas occupant configuration (population size) plays less of a factor. The results further demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the crawling speed given the exit access width available, due to the secondary effect of crowd density. The relationship between crowd crawling speed and density is best represented by a quadratic regression model. The study concludes with the need to continuously develop new predictive movement methods, or enhance existing ones in order to cope with the level of detail required to ensure occupant safety and model complexity.},

The deterioration of environmental conditions influences occupants to adopt new responses. This study investigates crawling movement as a physical response to environmental conditions during a fire. The study investigates occupant crawling speed compared with walking speed, and the effect of occupant characteristics; gender and body composition (BMI), on crawling during an evacuation. Eighteen subjects (nine males and nine females) within the 19-29 age stratum participated in the study (normal, overweight, and obese body composition). The findings indicate a statistical significance between normal walking and crawling speeds. Further, the study statistically demonstrates that both gender and body composition significantly impact individual crawling speed as they are unique individual characteristics. More research is needed to better understand the effect of age group, mobility capabilities, and fatigue on crawling speed. The study concludes that the development of crawling data and its representation in evacuation models will enhance the accuracy of evacuation models, and better evaluate the safety of evacuees.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Gaining a better understanding of pedestrian perceptions of level of service (LOS) in urban areas can be useful in developing strategies for providing a comfortable and safe walking environment. Using a sample of 114 respondents, this research studies how pedestrians perceive \{LOS\} on sidewalks shared with bicycles under various urban-street conditions. To do this, 15 carefully constructed video clips of Chinese urban sidewalks are presented to respondents and, after each 60-s video clip, respondents were asked to assess the pedestrian level of service in the video on a scale from \{LOS\} A (the most comfortable pedestrian environment) to \{LOS\} F (the least comfortable pedestrian environment). By estimating random parameters ordered probability models of respondents’ \{LOS\} assessments (to account for unobserved heterogeneity across respondents) we found, as expected, that pedestrian perceptions of \{LOS\} are strongly influenced by the pedestrian flow rate. However, many other factors were found to significantly affect \{LOS\} perceptions including sidewalk width, the presence of a barrier separating the sidewalk from motor-vehicle traffic, the presence of parking next to the sidewalk, the presence of businesses along the sidewalk, the bicycle flow rate, the speed of bicyclist, whether or not bicycles were riding against the flow of pedestrians, weather conditions, time of day, and age of the respondent. The specific impacts of the wide variety of factors that affect pedestrian perceptions of \{LOS\} suggest that a number of important tradeoffs need to be considered when planning pedestrian facilities.},

  Abstract                 = {A controlled experiment was conducted to determine the relative importance of pedestrian, vehicle, and situational factors in influencing drivers to give way to crossing pedestrians. The following variables were combined in a complete factorial design: (1) type of crossing; (2) distance between oncoming vehicle and pedestrian; (3) orientation of pedestrian; (4) number of pedestrians; and (5) approach velocity of vehicle.Trained pedestrians performed the start of an ordinary street crossing attempt and interacted with regular drivers whose response was measured in terms of changes in vehicle velocity. The experiment was replicated at two sites for a total of 960 crossing trials.The results show that drivers slowed down, or stopped more, for crossing pedestrians when: (1) the approach speed of the vehicle was low; (2) the crossing took place on a marked crosswalk; (3) there was a relatively long distance between the vehicle and the pedestrian's point of entry into the road; (4) a group of pedestrians, rather than an individual, attempted to cross; and, (5) the pedestrian did not look at the approaching vehicle. Additionally, female drivers and older drivers slowed down more than other drivers.Implications of the results for pedestrian safety, road design, and further research are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasing number of visitors at large-scale events combined with the increasing complexity of modern buildings set a major challenge for planners, operators and emergency services. Examples include multi-purpose arenas, large railway stations and airports. In this dissertation the use of modern parallel hardware in combination with optimised algorithms are for the ﬁrst time used on site to speed up the simulation of large crowds. The aim is to perform real-time forecasts of pedestrian traﬃc. For this purpose, special neighbourhood lists and a two-stage hybrid parallelisation are used. The second part of this dissertation deals with route choice in complex structures, which plays an important role in achieving realistic computer simulations of pedestrian ﬂows. The developed route choice process is based on visibility and perception of the local environment by the simulated agents. It has as basis a navigation graph. The generation of the graph, especially in complex structures, has also been performed within the framework of this thesis. The work is closed with an empirical study in which the route choice proﬁles of spectators during various football games and concert performances are analysed and compared with the proposed model. The runtime optimisation strategies and route choice algorithms have been successfully tested in the ESPRIT arena in Düsseldorf (Germany), where they have been integrated in an evacuation assistant.Keywords: pedestrian dynamics, route choice, evacuation, high performance computing.},

Four strategies are modelled to cover those groups. The modelled strategies are the shortest path (local and
global); They are combined with a quickest path approach, which is based on an observation principle. In the
quickest path approach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment and are routed
dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit analysis function. The dynamic modelling of
route choice with different strategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of influences which
appears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an evacuation process. To address
this question criteria are elaborated. The criteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time,
the individual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size itself. The influences
of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria are investigated. The sensibility of the system to
disturbances (e.g. broken escape route) is also analysed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents runtime optimisation approaches for a
real-time evacuation assistant. The pedestrian model used for the fore-
cast is a modification of the centrifugal force model which operates in
continuous space. It is combined with an event driven route choice algo-
rithm which encompasses the local shortest path, the global shortest path
and a combination with the quickest path. A naive implementation of this
model has the complexity of O(N 2 ), N being the number of pedestrians.
In the first step of the optimisation the complexity is reduced to O(N ) us-
ing special neighbourhood lists like Verlet-List or Linked-Cell commonly
used in molecular dynamics. The next step in this optimisation process
is parallelisation on a multicore system. The Message Passing Interface
(MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) application programming
interfaces are used to this extend. The simulation is performed on the Ju-
ropa cluster installed at the J Ìˆlich Supercomputing Centre. The speedup
u
factors obtained are âˆ¼ 10 for the linked-cells, âˆ¼ 4 for 8 threads and âˆ¼ 3
for the parallelisation on 5 nodes using a static domain decomposition.},

ings or large scale facilities, where computing time is not an issue at all. The collaborative Hermes project
[1] aims at improving the safety of mass events by constructing an evacuation assistant, a decision sup-
port system for heads of operation in an actual evacuation. For this, the status (occupancy and available
egress routes) of a facility is constantly monitored with automatic person counters, door sensors, smoke
sensors, and manual input from security staff. Starting from this status, egress is simulated faster than
real time, and the result visualized in a suitable fashion to show what is likely to happen in the next
15 min. The test case for this evacuation assistant is the clearing of the ESPRIT Arena in Düsseldorf which
holds 50,000–65,000 persons depending on the event type. The on site prediction requires the ability to
simulate the egress in %2 min, a task that requires the combination of a fast algorithm and a parallel com-
puter. The paper will describe the details of the evacuation problem, the architecture of the evacuation
assistant, the pedestrian motion model employed and the optimization and parallelization of the code.},

The PEDFLOW model has been implemented in the parallel processing language Occam as an agent-based evolutionary system, which allows extensive modelling of detailed pedestrian behaviour with minimal complication.

  Abstract                 = {Vehicular traffic is a classical example of a multi-agent system in which autonomous drivers operate in a shared environment. The article provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in microscopic traffic modeling and the implications for simulation techniques. We focus on the short-time dynamics of car-following models which describe continuous feedback control tasks (acceleration and braking) and models for discrete-choice tasks as a response to the surrounding traffic. The driving style of an agent is characterized by model parameters such as reaction time, desired speed, desired time gap, anticipation etc. In addition, internal state variables corresponding to the agent's "mind" are used to incorporate the driving experiences. We introduce a time-dependency of some parameters to describe the frustration of drivers being in a traffic jam for a while. Furthermore, the driver's behavior is externally influenced by the neighboring vehicles and also by environmental input such as limited motorization and braking power, visibility conditions and road traffic regulations. A general approach for dealing with discrete decision problems in the context of vehicular traffic is introduced and applied to mandatory and discretionary lane changes. Furthermore, we consider the decision process whether to brake or not when approaching a traffic light turning from green to amber. Another aspect of vehicular traffic is related to the heterogeneity of drivers. We discuss a hybrid system of coupled vehicle and information flow which can be used for developing and testing applications of upcoming inter-vehicle communication techniques.},

The three components of the concept are the ACC itself, implemented in the form of a car-following model, an algorithm for the automatic real-time detection of the tra?c situation based on local information, and a strategy matrix to adapt the driving characteristics (that is, the parameters of the ACC controller) to the tra?c conditions. Optionally, inter-vehicle and infrastructure-to-car communication can be used to improve the accuracy of determining the tra?c states. Within a microscopic simulation framework, we have simulated the complete concept on a road section with an on-ramp bottleneck, using empirical loop-detector data for an afternoon rush-hour as input for the upstream boundary. We found that the ACC vehicles improve the tra?c stability and the dynamic road capacity. While tra?c congestion in the reference scenario was completely eliminated when simulating a proportion of 25% ACC vehicles, travel times were already signi?cantly reduced for much lower penetration rates. The e?ciency of the proposed driving strategy even for low market penetrations is a promising result for a successful application in future driver assistance systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Predtechenskii and Milinskii's seminal work [1] in relation to pedestrian flows is well known. However, analysis of the experimental results and observations obtained from this series of experimental studies revealed the inherent statistical non-homogeneity of pedestrian flow speeds [2]. As such, the results of these individual experiments cannot be integrated to produce a valid general expression V=f(D) for each type of pedestrian flow path ,where V is the flow velocity and D is the flow density. This paper presents further pedestrian flow research conducted in Russia post 1969. In this paper pedestrian flow is treated as a stochastic process, ie, that which might be observed in a series of experiments as a manifestation of the random function V=f(D). A fundamentally new random methodology to mathematically describe this function is presented. Corresponding computer simulation models "Analysis of Foot Traffic Flow Probability" (ADLPV) [3-7, 9-10] and "Free Foot Traffic Flow" (SDLP) [3, 8, 9, 11] are described. The high degree of correspondence between observed pedestrian flows and the output from these models has been sufficient for the models to be accepted by statutory authorities and used in building design and regulation in Russia [12-14] for many years.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work several questions of biological and social systems are studied with methods of statistical physics. Two different topics are discussed in detail.

In chapter 2 various evolution models for the description of sympatric speciation are proposed and investigated. A system of coupled differential equations for the description of asexual reproducing populations is studied in detail. Depending on the parameters of the model, different stable coexistences between the populations are observed.
The statistical properties of genom models for the inheritance of discrete traits are derived. With the aid of these genom models discrete and continuous time equations for the description of sexual reproducing populations are investigated. Depending on the parameter choice, stable coexistences between reproductive isolated populations are shown. This coexistences can be interpreted as sympatric speciation.

In chapter 3 a 2-dimensional cellular automaton model for the description of pedestrian dynamics is presented. The model is extremely time and memory efficient and it is able to reproduce many collective effects encountered in pedestrian dynamics. This is achieved by introducing two so-called floor fields S and D which mediate the long-range interactions between the pedestrians. At this the static floor field S contains all informations about the inanimate surroundings. The dynamic floor field D is a virtual trace left by the pedestrians and is used to model an attractive
interaction between the particles.
First simple evacuation scenarios are studied. It is shown that the variation of the model parameters allows to describe three different main regimes of particle behaviour, from regular to panic. A non-monotonic dependence of evacuation times on the parameters of the model is found.
Further the role of conflicts in pedestrian traffic, i.e. the situation when two or more people try to enter the same space, is investigated. Due to clogging and stucking such conflicts can lead to very dangerous situations and emergancys. In the model such stucking phenomena can be modelled very well due to the introduction of the stochastic friction parameter Âµ. Some results are in good agreement to empirical data.
For the modelling of arbitrary walking speeds the model is extended in that way, that particles are allowed to move not only to nearest neighbour cells. Fundamental diagrams of the model are studied. They are in good agreement to empirical data. Finally the effects of a higher discretisation of the underlying geometrical structure are investigated. The discretisation has strong influences on the quantities of the model.},

  Abstract                 = {We study discretization effects in cellular automata models for pedestrian dynamics by reducing the cell size. Then a particle occupies more than one cell which leads to subtle effects in the dynamics, e.g. non-local conflict situations. Results from computer simulations of the floor field model are compared with empirical findings. Furthermore, the influence of increasing the maximal walking speed vmax is investigated by increasing the interaction range beyond nearest neighbour interactions. The extension of the model to vmax > 1 turns out to be a severe challenge which can be solved in different ways. Four major variants are discussed that take into account different dynamical aspects. The variation of vmax has a strong influence on the shape of the flow-density relation. We show that walking speeds vmax > 1 lead to results which are in very good agreement with empirical data.},

Monte Carlo simulations of evacuation processes are compared with experimental results on competitive behavior in emergency egress from an aircraft. In the model, the recently introduced concept of a friction parameter (nyh) is used to distinguish between competitive and cooperative movement. However, an additional influence in competition is increased walking speed. Empirical results show that a critical door width wc separates two regimes: for w<wc, competition increases egress times, whereas for w>wc it leads to a decrease. This result is reproduced in the simulation only if both influences, walking speed and friction, are taken into account.},

Therefore a recently introduced cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics is extended by a friction parameter my. This parameter controls the probability that the movement of all particles involved in a conflict is denied at one time step. It is shown that these conflicts are not an undesirable artifact of the parallel update scheme, but are important for a correct description of the dynamics. The friction parameter my can be interpreted as a kind of an internal local pressure between the pedestrians which becomes important in regions of high density, occurring, e.g., in panic situations. We present simulations of the evacuation of a large room with one door. It is found that friction has not only quantitative effects, but can also lead to qualitative changes, e.g., of the dependence of the evacuation time on the system parameters. We also observe similarities to the flow of granular materials, e.g., arching effects.},

  Abstract                 = {The movement of crowds is a field of research that attracts increasing interest. This is due to three major reasons: pattern formation and selforganization processes that occur in crowd dynamics, the advancement of simulation techniques and hardware that enable fast and realistic simulations, and finally the growing area of potential applications (planning of pedestrian facilities, crowd management, or evacuation analysis). The field is spanning the borders of various disciplines: physiology, psychology, sociology, civil engineering, mathematics, physics, etc. It depends on the point of view which
aspects are given the main focus. One approach is to reduce complexity to fundamental principles that make a mathematical (quantitative) formulation possible and at the same time are sufficiently complex to reproduce the major phenomena that can be observed in reality.
The major aim of this dissertation is to define and validate a model for the simulation of evacuation processes and their analysis. To this end the analogy between non-equilibrium many particle systems and crowds is used. However, it will also become clear that this analogy is not sufficient for complex scenarios and realistic egress simulations and additional, 'non-physical', parameters and principles must be introduced. Even though the investigation is motivated by the applications, the dynamics of crowd movement and model properties are scrutinized. This also includes a thorough review of the
data available in the literature, the calibration of the model parameters and the comparison of simulated and empirical flow-density relations.
The core of any evacuation simulation is a set of rules or equations for the movement of people. This is connected to the representation of space, population, and behavior. These topics will be investigated generally (micro- vs. macroscopic, discrete vs. continuous) and especially with regard to a specific two-dimensional cellular automaton model, where the movement dynamics is based on discrete space and time. This allows an efficient implementation and therefore large scale simulations. The route-choice is done via the orientation along a discrete vector field which can in principal be derived from a discrete potential. It is therefore not explicitly simulated but taken into account in a pre-determined way, i.e., the coupling to the vector field is static (constant coupling parameter). In addition to the model characteristics, extensions like competition, multiple and dynamically varying orientation potentials or coupling parameters, or individual egress routes are discussed.
In order to validate the simulation results and the application to full-scale problems, simulations for realistic scenarios are performed and compared to data from evacuation trials. Design variants, aspects of crowd management, or operational measures to optimize evacuation performance are also mentioned. However, they are the task of experts (architects, psychologists, safety engineers) who might use simulations as a design and evaluation tool. Therefore, these results are rather case studies supplementing the major topics of the model characteristics and implementation.},

  Abstract                 = {The modeling of pedestrian movement has received growing interest over the last decades. This is due to the potential applications in facility design and especially evacuation simulation as well as the fascination of its fundamental properties. Empirical data plays a particular role with respect to both aspects. The key challenge in modeling and simulating crowd movement is to validate the model assumptions on the one hand and to verify the simulation results on the other hand. In this paper we present empirical data on an evacuation exercise in a primary school. About two hundred pupils (and their teachers) took part in the drill. Three drills were carried out. The premises are divided into two separate buildings, the larger one containing 6 classrooms with about 120 pupils. The results of the exercise are reported. Additionally, the time measured is compared to the time distribution gained from simulations.},

To map large-scale orientation of pedestrians, we extended this model by a navigation graph. We describe the basic model as well as the graph layer extension. We use this graph as a basis for different routing algorithms, thus modeling different types of pedestrians, for example ones being familiar and ones being not familiar with the location. We discuss the results of the experiment and simulation and give an outlook for further improvement of our algorithms for a better simulation of the empirical data.},

  Abstract                 = {Traffic flow is a very prominent example of a driven non-equilibrium system. A characteristic phenomenon of traffic dynamics is the spontaneous and abrupt drop of the average velocity on a stretch of road leading to congestion. Such a traffic breakdown corresponds to a boundary-induced phase transition from free flow to congested traffic. In this paper, we study the ability of selected microscopic traffic models to reproduce a traffic breakdown, and we investigate its spatiotemporal dynamics. For our analysis, we use empirical traffic data from stationary loop detectors on a German Autobahn showing a spontaneous breakdown. We then present several methods to assess the results and compare the models with each other. In addition, we will also discuss some important modeling aspects and their impact on the resulting spatiotemporal pattern. The investigation of different downstream boundary conditions, for example, shows that the physical origin of the traffic breakdown may be artificially induced by the setup of the boundaries.},

  Abstract                 = {The most crucial aspect of a building's safety in the face of fire is the possibility of safe escape. An important precondition is that its fire safety facilities enable independent and adequate fire response performances by the building's occupants. In practice, it appears that the measures currently required by law do not always provide the support that people in burning buildings need. Consequently, understanding how individuals behave in the case of fire and fire evacuation is essential if we are to bring fire safety measures into line with occupantsâ€™ needs during an incident. This paper contains a review of the available literature on human behaviour in a fire so far as building safety is concerned. The findings are presented as an overview of the critical factors which determine occupantsâ€™ fire response performances, namely the characteristics of fire, human beings and buildings. The study highlights that some of the assumptions about the existing paradigm of fire safety in buildings are not consistent with the knowledge set out in the literature. The key observation is that psychonomics appear to have significant influence on occupantsâ€™ fire response performances. Accordingly, the traditional approach to fire safety will have to be supplemented by scientific knowledge from this field. Hence, there is a need for a new approach to fire safety design in buildings, which is set out herein. },

  Abstract                 = {Pedestrian simulation has many applications in computer games, military simulations and animation systems. A realistic pedestrian simulation requires a realistic pedestrian behavioral model that takes into account the various behavioral aspects of a real pedestrian. In this paper, we describe our work on such a model that aims to generate human-like pedestrian behaviors. To this end, various important factors in a real-pedestrian's decision-making process are considered in our model. These factors include a pedestrian's sensory, attention, memory and navigational behaviors. In particular, a two-level navigation model has been proposed to generate realistic navigational behavior. As a result, our pedestrian model is able to generate various realistic behaviors such as overtaking, waiting, side stepping and lane-forming in a crowded area. The simulated pedestrians are also able to navigate through complex environment given an abstract map of the environment.},

The long-term system dynamics, stationary states, and the nature of phase transitions between steady states can be understood in terms of the interplay of two characteristic velocities, the collective velocity and the shock (domain wall) velocity. This interplay results in two distinct types of domain walls whose dynamics is computed. We conclude that the phase diagram of the ASEP is generic for one-component driven lattice gases with a single maximum in the current-density relation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents new evacuation strategies for a heterogeneous population in high-rise building environments and compares them with traditional simultaneous evacuation strategy. To do so, we first define the maximum comfortable structural capacity of the building as the number of people that can be evacuated without heavy congestion, and estimate it based on flow rate and move frequency ratio. Then we present several evacuation strategies to efficiently evacuate heterogeneous residents at the maximum comfortable structural capacity. The simulation results for a 24-story building suggest several implications for emergency planners. First, we find that a vertically phased evacuation strategy that varies delay times by physical location, is not useful for the simulated building. Second, a phased evacuation strategy that applies a fixed evacuation delay to residents with wheelchairs reduces the aggregated evacuation times, but delaying evacuations of a specific group of individuals may not be ethical or accepted. Finally, evacuation strategies that allows residents with wheelchairs to use elevators are effective, suggesting that emergency administrators should assess whether elevators in their buildings are appropriate for evacuation purposes with appropriate electric controls, electric power, and fire and smoke protection. },

  Abstract                 = {On July 24, 2010, 21 people died and more than 500 were injured in a stampede at the Loveparade, a music festival, in Duisburg, Germany. Although this tragic incident is but one among many terrible crowd disasters that occur during pilgrimage, sports events, or other mass gatherings, it stands out for it has been well documented: there were a total of seven security cameras monitoring the Loveparade and the chain of events that led to disaster was meticulously reconstructed. In this paper, we present an automatic, video-based analysis of the events in Duisburg. While physical models and simulations of human crowd behavior have been reported before, to the best of our knowledge, automatic vision systems that detect congestions and dangerous crowd turbulences in real world settings were not reported yet. Derived from lessons learned from the video footage of the Loveparade, our system is able to detect motion patterns that characterize crowd behavior in stampedes. Based on our analysis, we propose methods for the detection and early warning of dangerous situations during mass events. Since our approach mainly relies on optical flow computations, it runs in real-time and preserves privacy of the people being monitored. },

  Abstract                 = {For simulation models of pedestrian dynamics there are always the issues of calibration and validation.
These are usually done by comparing measured properties of the dynamics found in observation,
experiments and simulation in certain scenarios. For this the scenarios first need to be sensitive to
parameter changes of a particular model or – if models are compared – differences between models.
Second it is helpful if the exhibited differences can be expressed in quantities which are as simple as
possible ideally a single number. Such a scenario is proposed in this contribution together with evaluation
measures. In an example evaluation of a particular model it is shown that the proposed evaluation
measures are very sensitive to parameter changes and therefore summarize differences effects of
parameter changes and differences between models efficiently, sometimes in a single number. It is shown
how the symmetry which exists in the achiral geometry of the proposed example scenario is broken in
particular simulation runs exhibiting chiral dynamics, while in the statistics of 1,000 simulation runs there
is a symmetry between left- and right-chiral dynamics. In the course of the symmetry breaking
differences between models and parameter settings are amplified which is the origin of the high
sensitivity of the scenario against parameter changes.},

  Abstract                 = {When a large group of pedestrians moves around a corner, most pedestrians do not follow the shortest path, which is to stay as close as possible to the inner wall, but try to minimize the travel time. For this they accept to move on a longer path with some distance to the corner, to avoid large densities and by this succeed in maintaining a comparatively high speed. In many models of pedestrian dynamics the basic rule of motion is often either 'move as far as possible toward the destination' or -- reformulated -- 'of all coordinates accessible in this time step move to the one with the smallest distance to the destination'. On top of this rule modifications are placed to make the motion more realistic. These modifications usually focus on local behavior and neglect long-ranged effects. Compared to real pedestrians this leads to agents in a simulation valuing the shortest path a lot better than the quickest. So, in a situation such as the movement of a large crowd around a corner, one needs an additional element in a model of pedestrian dynamics that makes the agents deviate from the rule of the shortest path. In this work it is shown how this can be achieved by using a flood fill dynamic potential field method, where during the filling process the value of a field cell is not increased by 1, but by a larger value, if it is occupied by an agent.
This idea may be an obvious one: however, the tricky part -- and therefore in a strict sense the contribution of this work -- is (a) to minimize unrealistic artifacts, as naive flood fill metrics deviate considerably from the Euclidean metric and in this respect yield large errors, (b) do this with limited computational effort and (c) keep agents' movement at very low densities unaltered.},

The results include comparatively large fluxes and speeds as well as a maximal asymmetry between left- and right-hand traffic.

  Abstract                 = {In this work results from an examination of upstairs walking speeds at the outer stairway of the Dutch pavilion at the Expo 2000 in Hannover are presented. The distribution of horizontal walking speeds exhibits a maximum between 0.4 and 0.5 m/s, depending on the local density. To underline the need to measure walking speeds on long stairways if one wants to predict travelling times on long stairways, these results are compared to a second study of walking speeds on a short stair. The main result of that measurement is, that some people actually accelerate when walking upward a short stairway, while such a phenomenon could neither be observed for downward motion on the short stairway nor for upward motion on the long stairway. The mean upward walking speed on the short stairway was found to be roughly twice as large as the one on the long stairway, which corresponds to the data found in the literature. Both studies were done by digitally filming the walking persons and evaluating the resulting material frame by frame for the walking times. Together the results suggest, that the speed on stairs does not only vary greatly depending on the length of the stairway, but also that there is no common scaling factor for the speed on stairs in dependence of the length of the stairway for the whole population. This has consequences, e.g. for the construction of simulation models.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a modified lattice gas model to simulate pedestrian counter flow by considering the effect of following strength which can lead to appropriate responses to some complicated situations. Periodic and open boundary conditions are adopted respectively. The simulation results show that the presented model can reproduce some essential features of pedestrian counter flows, e.g., the lane formation and segregation effect. The fundamental diagrams show that the complete jamming density is independent of the system size only when the width W and the length L are larger than some critical values respectively, and the larger asymmetrical conditions can better avoid the occurrence of deadlock phenomena. For the mixed pedestrian flow, it can be found that the jamming cluster is mainly caused by those walkers breaking the traffic rules, and the underlying mechanism is analysed. Furthermore, the comparison of simulation results and the experimental data is performed, it is shown that this modified model is reasonable and more
realistic to simulate and analyse pedestrian counter flow.},

Four types of walkers including faster right walkers, slower right walkers, faster left walkers and slower left walkers are involved in the simulation. The simulation results show that our model can capture some essential features of pedestrian counter flows, such as the lane formation, segregation effect and phase separation at higher densities. We also find that the subconscious effect can reduce the occurrence of jam cluster evidently compared with the case of un-subconscious effect. At large maximum velocity, the critical density corresponding to the maximum flow rate of the fundamental diagram is in good agreement with the empirical results.},

The building's population comprised of a diverse array of older adults and disabled residents descending the stairwells by the following methods: self-evacuation without assistance, assistance using a cane, assistance from another occupant or firefighter, or assistance using a stair chair. Movement data of these specific groups was compared and contrasted with other data collected on mobility-impaired individuals. In the current study, the National Institute of Standards and Technology observed overall average speeds ranging between (0.11 to 0.29)&#xa0;m/s, which in some cases, approximate the speeds of disabled people and older adults found in earlier studies, and in other cases is slower than previous studies. Slower speeds in this case may have resulted from observing a wider variety of mobility impairments (since the building observed was an assisted-living facility) and evacuation assistance provided by untrained populations. These data provide an adequate confirmation of exiting literature values typically used for disabled movement speeds in addition to updated values for future analyses. },

  Abstract                 = {Based on fluid-dynamic and many-particle (car-following) simulations of traffic flows in (urban) networks, we study the problem of coordinating incompatible traffic flows at intersections. Inspired by the observation of self-organized oscillations of pedestrian flows at bottlenecks, we propose a self-organization approach to traffic light control. The problem can be treated as a multi-agent problem with interactions between vehicles and traffic lights. Specifically, our approach assumes a priority-based control of traffic lights by the vehicle flows themselves, taking into account short-sighted anticipation of vehicle flows and platoons. The considered local interactions lead to emergent coordination patterns such as 'green waves' and achieve an efficient, decentralized traffic light control. While the proposed self-control adapts flexibly to local flow conditions and often leads to non-cyclical switching patterns with changing service sequences of different traffic flows, an almost periodic service may evolve under certain conditions and suggests the existence of a spontaneous synchronization of traffic lights despite the varying delays due to variable vehicle queues and travel times. The self-organized traffic light control is based on an optimization and a stabilization rule, each of which performs poorly at high utilizations of the road network, while their proper combination reaches a superior performance. The result is a considerable reduction not only in the average travel times, but also of their variation. Similar control approaches could be applied to the coordination of logistic and production processes.},

  Abstract                 = {A model for the simulation of pedestrian flows and crowd dynamics has been developed. The model is based on a series of forces, such as:will forces (the desire to reach a place at a certain time), pedestrian collision avoidance forces, obstacle/wall avoidance forces; pedestrian contact forces, and obstacle/wall contact forces. Except for the will force, it is assumed that for any given pedestrian these forces are the result of only local (nearest neighbour) situations. The near-neighbour search problem is solved by an efficient incremental Delaunay triangulation that is updated at every timestep. In order to allow for general geometries a so-called background triangulation is used to carry all geographic information. At any given time the location of any given pedestrian is updated on this mesh.The results obtained to date show that the model performs well for standard benchmarks, and allows for typical crowd dynamics, such as lane forming,overtaking, avoidance of obstacles and panic behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {A model of crowd motion that considers each pedestrian as a Newtonian particle subject to both physical and social forces was reported by Helbing, Farkas, and Vicsek in 2000. Subsequent numerical simulations of this model, performed by its authors, showed that it exhibits realistic crowd behavior. In this article, the authors point out that numerical values of certain parameters in that model may produce counterintuitive results when applied to the motion of an isolated pedestrian or a small number of pedestrians. They have considered modifications of the original model, which allow them to use parameter values that, in the aforementioned sense, are more realistic. However, this is achieved by introducing more features and parameters into the original model. These features are described, and some results of the numerical simulations of the modified model are presented. Two major results of their study need to be mentioned. First, they developed an algorithm, based on an explicit numerical integration scheme, which prevents simulated pedestrians from overlapping with one another in physical space. Second, they demonstrated how the form of the social repulsive force between two pedestrians may be deduced from certain measured characteristics of pedestrian flows.},

The effects of bi-directional pedestrian flows are investigated empirically with particular emphasis on their effects on walking time for different directions of flow at pedestrian walkways in Hong Kong. Flow measurements were conducted at selected indoor walkways in urban areas. A generalized walking time function that takes bi-directional flow distributions (or flow ratios) into account is proposed for these pedestrian facilities and calibrated for various flow conditions ranging from free-flow to congested-flow (at-capacity) situations. The bi-directional flow effects on free-flow walking speed, effective capacity and at-capacity walking speed are validated with observed data. It was found that the bi-directional flow ratios have significant impacts on both the at-capacity walking speeds and the maximum flow rates of the selected walkways but not on the free-flow walking speeds. The findings and study methodology provide better insight into the effects of bi-directional pedestrian flow characteristics and will assist engineers/planners in improving the design and operation of pedestrian facilities not only in Hong Kong, but also in other countries as well.},

  Abstract                 = {A Discrete Element Method (DEM) technique for modelling crowd dynamics is developed. Each person is represented by three overlapping circles with a position, orientation and velocity in 2D. Contact forces between elements are modelled as well as psychological forces and motive forces and moments. Motion is then modelled in a Newtonian manner with a numerical integration time-stepping scheme. The model is tested on a single enclosure entry scenario where some model parameters are scaled. Motion is generally realistic, although areas for improvement are identified. Flow and contact forces are monitored under different scenarios. The model is then used on a multi-enclosure entry scenario. It is shown that stewarding significantly reduces contact forces and hence risk of injury. The potential for further applications is demonstrated on hypothetical scenarios on the London Underground.

It is concluded that the model is reasonably realistic for dense crowd flow scenarios, but more complex situations like a supermarket would require aspects of Artificial Intelligence in the model, which is a feasible development. The three-circle representation gives a reasonable model of the 2D geometry.},

  Abstract                 = {The variation of walking speeds for passengers passing through a facility within a congested underground station is known to be an important factor influencing pedestrian route choices. This paper describes a study of walking speed variation under unidirectional and bidirectional pedestrian flow conditions in Hong Kong, China, mass transit railway stations. The studied facilities selected for data collection and analysis include a unidirectional walkway and a bidirectional stairway. The variation in walking speed is due to increased passenger demand in the station when trains arrive. A study of the distribution of walking speed variation and relationships between average walking speed and variations of that speed was conducted based on data collected from an observation survey. For uncongested sections, when the mean walking speed decreased, the walking speed variation also decreased under both unidirectional and bidirectional pedestrian flow conditions. In addition, the walking speed variation was smallest when pedestrian flow approached capacity. However, in congested sections, when the mean walking speed decreased, the walking speed variation increased under both unidirectional and bidirectional pedestrian flow conditions. All walking time data were empirically proved to present a normal distribution. This paper presents newly developed walking speed variation models for three selected pedestrian facilities. These models can be further considered in connection with pedestrian simulation models to assess alternative improvement schemes at urban railway stations.},

  Abstract                 = {Reconstruction is a key step of the motion capture process. The quality of motion data first results from the quality of raw data. However, it also depends on the motion reconstruction step, especially when raw data suffer markers losses or noise due, for example, to challenging conditions of capture. Labeling is a final and crucial data reconstruction step that enable practical use of motion data (e.g., analysis). The lower the quality of data, the more time consuming and tedious the labeling step because human intervention cannot be avoided: he has to manually indicate markers label and start again each time a loss of the marker in time occur. In the context of crowd study, we faced such situation when we performed experiments on the locomotion of groups of people. Data reconstruction poses several problems such as markers labeling, inter- polation and mean position computation. While Vicon IQ software has difficulties to automatically label markers for the crowd experiment we carried out, we propose a specific method to label our data and estimate participants mean positions with incomplete data.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A pedestrian evacuation simulation model based on the extended cellular automata is proposed with the consideration of heterogeneous behavioral tendencies in humans. We investigated two behavioral tendencies, namely, familiarity and aggressiveness. Our simulation experiments tested the values of the behavioral parameters and the pedestrian flow composition. The model is calibrated and validated by using hand calculation, fundamental diagrams of traffic flow and evacuation experiments. The results show that the evacuation time decreases exponentially with an increase in the evacueesâ€™ site familiarity and increases when pedestrians are either too conservative or too aggressive. The optimum evacuation was associated with higher familiarity and no aggressive preference. Altering the conservative compositions of pedestrian groups showed that there is a turning point for each density, depending on the proportions of conservative pedestrians. Prior to this point, the evacuation time is a relatively constant value. After this point, the evacuation time increases and fluctuates. This finding demonstrates that at high densities, a few leaders in pedestrians can significantly reduce the evacuation time. The model is able to simulate evacuation effectively given the diverse behavior strategies of evacuees, such as herding and communication between evacuees. In addition, the model can explain some basic principles of fundamental diagrams of traffic flow. Furthermore, the model is applied to optimize buildings to reduce evacuation times. Case studies show that the evacuation time can be dramatically decreased if a building is optimized to reduce interactions between different groups of pedestrians by separating flows or expanding the exit width. However, such strategies are effective only under high pedestrian densities. Placing signs and guides is also helpful for improving the evacuation performance. We conclude that behavioral tendencies have a strong influence on evacuation time. },

Without the limit of ''lanes'' pedestrian movement is loose and free. Furthermore, they are easily affected by other walkers as well as the environment around.

By simulating the two-dimension pedestrian movement in corridor, the phase transition phenomena of pedestrian movement, including the walkers moving bottom-up and top-down, are presented. Studying on the effect of possibility of exchange position between face-to-face pedestrians propose that the considerable exchange possibility is about 0.20 in the scope studied in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, evacuation dynamics in an office building is studied by experiment and simulation. A lattice gas (LG) model is developed. A parameter called 'exit bias' is introduced into the model to describe the occupants' familiarity with different exits in a building. The evacuation experiment, which consists of seven scenarios under various conditions, is conducted to verify the model and calibrate the model's input parameters such as pedestrian speed and exit bias. The effect of exit width on flow rate, and the effect of occupants' familiarity with the building on their route selections, are studied. It is found that the accuracy of simulation depends a lot on the model's pedestrian speed. The optimal pedestrian speed is decided by not only occupant characteristics, but also flow features determined by people distribution, building structure, environment pressure, etc. LG models with proper pedestrian speed are capable of simulating the dynamic process of orderly emergency evacuations.},

Results show that staircases connecting platform and ticket hall, are identified as the â€œbottleneckâ€� positions during evacuation, where crowd congestion appears easily. Moreover, the effects of the stair effective width on evacuation were evaluated by the combination of the total evacuation time and the stairway level of service, to obtain more objective evaluation. Effect of varying the stair width was studied by taking eight different values. Results show that with the decrease of the stairs effective evacuation width, the crowded degree in the stairway during the subway emergency evacuation process can be effectively relieved. },

The parameters controlling the free speed and the anisotropy of social force between pedestrians are calibrated based on the experimental values. With the adjusted values of the parameters, FDS+Evac is able to reproduce the experimental process with respect to the flow through the bottleneck. However, other pedestrian characteristics in the simulations do not match with those in the experiments. This study shows that the validation of FDS+Evac should not only consider single pedestrian characteristics. More careful calibration of parameters and comprehensive analysis are necessary before FDS+Evac is used for security-related applications in general.},

Besides the main static floor field, an extra sub-static floor field was introduced to describe the exit-selection behaviour more accurately. The effects of the spatial distances from evacuees to the exits and the occupant densities around the exits upon the exit-selection process were studied. The model parameters were calibrated using experimental data. The results show that the layout of ticket-inspectors has significant effects on evacuation efficiency. In high density situations The Concave layout gives the maximum flow rate, while the Convex one gives the minimum most likely due to the heterogeneous distribution. Various layouts lead to different flow distributions, which determine the difficulty of reaching an exit. Pedestrians compete frequently at medium crowd density. The Convex layout gives the most frequent competition, while The Concave one leads to the least. This work can be helpful for the design of multiple exits and the management of large-scale crowds. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we introduce an ASEP-like transport model for bidirectional motion of particles on a multi-lane lattice. The model is motivated by in vivo experiments on organelle motility along a microtubule (MT), consisting of thirteen protofilaments, where particles are propelled by molecular motors (dynein and kinesin). In the model, organelles (particles) can switch directions of motion due to 'tug-of-war' events between counteracting motors. Collisions of particles on the same lane can be cleared by switching to adjacent protofilaments (lane changes). We analyse transport properties of the model with no-flux boundary conditions at one end of a MT ('plus end' or tip). We show that the ability to make lane changes can affect the transport efficiency and the particle-direction change rate obtained from experiments is close to optimal for achieving efficient motor and organelle transport in a living cell. In particular, we find a nonlinear scaling of the mean tip size (the number of particles accumulated at the tip) with injection rate and an associated phase transition leading to pulsing states characterized by periodic filling and emptying of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, in many countries around the world there have been many disasters caused by crushing in dense crowds. For example, the 1992 Lan Kwai Fong disaster in Hong Kong [20 people crushed to death], 1996 Guatemala City disaster [84 deaths in a football stadium], 2000 Denmark Music Festival [8 deaths in a stampeding crowd], 2001 Johannesberg disaster [43 deaths in Ellis Park stadium], 2001 Lubumbashi of Congo [14 deaths in a football stadium], 2001 Ghana disaster [126 deaths at a football match], 2001 Aracaju of Brazil [4 deaths in a prize giving event], 2001 Akashi of Japan [10 deaths in a Firework display], 2001 Sofia of Bulgaria [7 deaths in a disco], 2002 Goma of Congo [4 deaths at a concert], 2003 Chicago [21 deaths in a Club Fire] and 2004 Miyun, Beijing [37 deaths in a stampeding crowd across a bridge]. This indicates that when large number of people gathering together, the crowd movement, especially under emergency situations, may be hazardous and that congestion may substantially restrict the crowd's movement. A granular dynamic method is proposed in this article to model the egress pattern of evacuees in a densely populated enclosed space. The method models individual movement patterns in that the inter-personal forces acting on each person have been considered by adopting a contracted boundary approach. The out-flow rate of exits of various sizes is studied and modelled by a simple equation.},

Hitherto, practical conventional parallelization strategies could achieve a complexity of O(np) with respect to the inter-processor communication, p being the number of processors. Our new approach can reduce the interprocessor communication complexity to a number O(np(hoch1/2)) . In the framework of Additive Number Theory, the determination of the optimal communication pattern can be formulated as h-range minimization problem that can be solved numerically. Based on a complexity model, the scaling behavior of the new algorithm is numerically tested on the connection machine CM5. As a real life example, we have implemented a fast code for globular cluster n-body simulations, a generic n(hoch2)-problem, on the CRAY T3D, with striking success. Our parallel method promises to be useful in various scientific and engineering fields like polymer chain computations, protein folding, signal processing, and, in particular, for parallel level-3 BLAS.},

This paper proposes a computational model for calculating the effective distance of EESs, taking into consideration an inertia effect as well as other factors that influence evacuation processes. The model is then incorporated into an evacuation model by extending the movement rules of cellular automata (CA). Finally, evacuation simulation experiments are conducted to confirm the necessity and rationality of computing the effective distance of EESs. The effective distance computational model can mirror the interaction between the evacuees and EESs, making the evacuation model even closer to the complexity and heterogeneity of a real evacuation. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, experiments of single-file pedestrian movement are conducted and the movement parameters of pedestrians are extracted with digital image processing method based on mean-shift algorithm. The microscopic characteristics of pedestrian dynamic including velocity, density, lateral oscillation etc, as well as their interrelations are obtained and analyzed. Firstly, we studied the lateral oscillation phenomena of pedestrian movement. The result indicates that the trajectory of pedestrians presents a wavy form and the amplitude of the oscillation keeps about 5.5 cm when the pedestrians move with free walking velocity, which is the velocity when there is no obvious interaction between sequential pedestrians; but when the movement velocity decreases to 0.27 m/s, the amplitude of oscillation increases to 13 cm. With the increasing density, the velocity decreases and the amplitude of oscillation presents a linear increase trend. The increasing oscillation amplitude widens occupation area of a pedestrian with low velocity, so as to make the moving efficiency even worse. Secondly, we study the frequency of the oscillation, the result indicates that the frequency maintains 2 Hz when pedestrians move with a free walking velocity, but presents a similar linear decrease trend when the velocity turns to a lower value. The decrease of oscillation frequency is also a negative feedback to the moving efficiency. Thirdly, it is found that with the increase of crowd density, the time interval between two sequential pedestrians increases, though the space gap between them decreases. The quantitative relation between time interval and crowd density is obtained. The study in this paper provides fundamental data and basic method for understanding pedestrian dynamics, developing and validating evacuation models. The results are also expected to be useful for the evacuation design.},

Generally, a building consists of enclosure areas such rooms, walkways and stairs. The principal problem in wayfinding is to select the way out when occupants egress from a multi-exit area. The choice of exits will depend on how groups of evacuees interact. Non-cooperative game theory deals largely with how intelligent individuals interact with one another in an effort to achieve their own goals - to leave the fire zone as fast as possible. This article presents a game theory based exit choice model for evacuation. It has been integrated in an evacuation model and demonstrates that the evacuees' interaction can affect the evacuation pattern and clearance time of a multi-exit zone.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The formulation of pedestrian floor field cellular automaton models is generally based on hypothetical assumptions to represent reality. This paper proposes a novel methodology to calibrate these models using experimental trajectories. The methodology is based on likelihood function optimization and allows verifying whether the parameters defining a model statistically affect pedestrian navigation. Moreover, it allows comparing different model specifications or the parameters of the same model estimated using different data collection techniques, e.g. virtual reality experiment, real data, etc. The methodology is here implemented using navigation data collected in a Virtual Reality tunnel evacuation experiment including 96 participants. A trajectory dataset in the proximity of an emergency exit is used to test and compare different metrics, i.e. Euclidean and modified Euclidean distance, for the static floor field. In the present case study, modified Euclidean metrics provide better fitting with the data. A new formulation using random parameters for pedestrian cellular automaton models is also defined and tested. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The pedestrians' safety and comfort levels within complex buildings have been attracting more and more attentions. To evaluate the safety and comfort performance of these built environments, a pedestrian space analysis model is incorporated with an agent-based pedestrian model on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Firstly, a bi-layer mesh method is proposed to divide the pedestrian space in complex building into cells. Secondly, the route from an origin to the destination is identified by considering the information of obstacles, entry and exit. After these procedures, a pedestrian space layer on \{GIS\} platform is constructed for further simulation. With this layer, pedestrians in the building can make fast decisions on where to move and finally move towards the destination step by step. As case studies, two different designs of train platform and a complex building have been modeled to evaluate the pedestrian flow patterns in them. The results indicated that the simulation platform on \{GIS\} can serve as a useful tool to evaluate pedestrian movement in transportation facilities. },

  Abstract                 = {A recent field study confirmed that animal crowd behavior is dominated by the interaction from the k-Nearest-Neighbors rather than all the neighbors in a given metric distance. For the reason that systems with local interaction perform similar self-organized phenomena, we in this paper build two models, i.e., a metric distance based model and a k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) counterflow model, based on a simple discrete cellular automaton model entitled the basic model, to investigate the fundamental interaction ruling pedestrian counter flow. Pedestrians move in a long channel and as a result are divided into left moving pedestrians and right moving pedestrians. These pedestrians interact with each other in different forms in different models. In the metric distance based model, ones direction of chosen behavior is influenced by all those who are in a small metric distance and come from the opposite direction; while in the kNN counterflow model, ones direction of chosen behavior is influenced by the distribution of a fixed number of the k-Nearest neighbors coming from the opposite direction. The self-organized lane formation is captured and factors affecting the number of lanes formed in the channel are investigated. Results imply that with varying density, the lane formation pattern is almost the same in the kNN counterflow model while it is not in the case of metric distance based model. This means that the kNN interaction plays a more fundamental role in the emergence of collective pedestrian phenomena. Then the kNN counterflow model is further validated by comparing the lane formation pattern and the fundamental diagram with real pedestrian counter flow. Reasons for the lane formation and improvement of flow rate are discussed. The relations among mean velocity, occupancy and total entrance density of the model are also studied. The results indicate that the kNN interaction provides a more efficient traffic condition, and is able to quantify features such as segregation and phase transition at high density of pedestrian traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the dynamics of pedestrian counter flow by using a multi-grid topological pedestrian counter flow model. In the model, each pedestrian occupies multi- rather than only one grid, and interacts with others in the form of topological interaction, which means that a moving pedestrian interacts with a fixed number of those nearest neighbours coming from the opposite direction to determine his/her own moving direction. Thus the discretization of space and time are much finer, the decision making process of the pedestrian is more reliable, which all together makes the moving behaviour and boundary conditions much more realistic. When compared with field observations, it can be found that the modified model is able to reproduce well fitted pedestrian collective behaviour such as dynamical variation of lane formation, clustering of pedestrians in the same direction, etc. The fundamental diagram produced by the model fits also well with field data in the free flow region. Further analyses indicate that with the increase of the size of pedestrian counter flow system, it becomes harder for the system to transit into a jamming state, while the increase of interaction range does not change the transition point from free flow to jamming flow in the multi-grid topological counter flow model. It is also found that the asymmetry of the injection rate of pedestrians on the boundaries has direct influence on the process of transition from free flow to jamming flow, i.e., a symmetric injection makes it easier for the system to transit into jamming flow.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this study, a very basic experiment of single-file bicycles moving in a circle passage was conducted. A video processing method was used to extract the relevant data such as trajectories, velocity, density, flow rate, time headway and so on. Afterwards, the relations between them were explained in detail. The relation between the flow rate and the density indicated that the flow rate is in proportion with the density before the congestion appears. It is also found that the interval between two bicycles is long but the time headway decreased as the density increased when the bicycles can move freely, while the situation is opposite when congestion occurs. Some of the results in this paper consist with those of other researchers. The purpose of this experiment is to provide basic experimental data and fundamental diagrams for single-file bicyclesâ€™ following movement. Results provided in this paper might be useful for validating related models and designing facility. },

For such an approximated system we prove existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions (in one space dimension) in the sense of Kruzkov (1970) [22], in which the boundary conditions are posed following the approach of Bardos et al. (1979) [7]. We use BV estimates on the density /rho and stability estimates on the potential /phi in order to prove uniqueness. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of characteristics for the original Hughes' model in one space dimension and study the behavior of simple solutions, in order to reproduce interesting phenomena related to the formation of shocks and rarefaction waves.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the modelling of crowd motion in highly packed configurations. We are especially interested in describing evacuation situations: people want to escape from a room, a building, a railway station or a plane, that may contain obstacles (walls, seats, tables, ...).
Many strategies have been followed to model crowd motions: macroscopic models [14, 9, 15], Cellular Automata [2, 16, 3], queuing models [17, 23] and microscopic models [8, 11]. The possibility that people may actually get into contact is usually handled indirectly (repulsive forces or adapted cut-off for microscopic models, exclusion principle for Cellular Automata or queuing models). We propose here to integrate a strong non-overlapping constraint in a ODE framework, in the spirit of granular flow models.
Our approach rests on two principles. On the one hand, we define a spontaneous velocity, which corresponds to the velocity each individual would like to have in the absence of other people. On the other hand, individuals (which are identified to rigid discs) must obey a non-overlapping constraint. Those two principles lead us to define the actual velocity field as the projection of the spontaneous velocity over the set of admissible velocities (regarding the nonoverlapping constraints). To perform this projection, we put the problem in a saddle-point form, which leads us to introduce a collection of Lagrange multipliers. Those Lagrange multipliers can be interpreted as interaction pressure between people which are in contact.},

A pronounced peak of the critical volume fraction as a function of the density fraction is found for large-size ratios of the pores. Such an increase of more than 10% even for small changes in composition of less than 1% is important in material science, where the accurate prediction of percolation thresholds for arbitrary shaped pores plays a fundamental role. A topological percolation criterion works well for dependence on shape and correlation. But none of the known explicit estimates for percolation thresholds is in reasonable quantitative agreement with the numerical data for polydisperse systems presented here.},

  Abstract                 = {Die steigende Anzahl von GroÃŸveranstaltungen und die wachsende KomplexitÃ¤t multifunktionaler GebÃ¤ude erfordern neue Strategien und Hilfsmittel, um die Sicherheit der Personen, insbesondere bei einer RÃ¤umung im Gefahrenfall, zu gewÃ¤hrleisten. Im Rahmen des Projekts Hermes wird am Beispiel der ESPRIT arena ein Evakuierungsassistent erforscht. Dieser soll die EntscheidungstrÃ¤ger (Betreiber, Polizei, Feuerwehr und Sicherheitsdienste) durch Stauprognosen unterstÃ¼tzen. In diesem Projekt ist die Aufgabe des JSC, eine Simulation von bis zu 60000 FuÃŸgÃ¤ngern schneller als in Echtzeit zu realisieren.

Im Rahmen der Masterarbeit wurde dieses Ziel durch den Einsatz von Nachbarschaftslisten unterstÃ¼tzt. Zwei verschiedene Methoden, Verlet- und Linked-Cell-Listen, wurden in Testszenarien mit homogener und inhomogener Personenverteilung hinsichtlich ihres Optimierungspotentials untersucht. Mithilfe der Nachbarschaftslisten konnte im Vergleich zur Brute-Force-Methode ein Performance-Gewinn bis zu einem Faktor 70 erzielt werden. Die Simulation eines Beispielszenarios zeigt jedoch, dass zusÃ¤tzliche OptimierungsmÃ¶glichkeiten erforderlich sind, um eine Simulation schneller als Echtzeit zu erreichen. 

Due to an increasing number of mass events and more complex multifunctional buildings new strategies and tools are required to guarantee the safety of pedestrians, in particular with regard to an evacuation in case of emergency. Within the project Hermes an evacuation assistant is being developed using the ESPRIT arena as a test environment. This tool is supposed to assist the decision makers (operator, police, fire department and security service) with congestion forecasts. The task of JSC is to implement a simulation of up to 60000 pedestrians which runs faster than real-time.

Within the master's thesis this aim was supported by the use of neighbor list techniques. The optimization potential of two different techniques, Verlet and Linked-cell lists, was analyzed in test cases of homogeneous and inhomogeneous pedestrian distributions. With the aid of the neighbor list techniques a speedup factor of 70 could be achieved compared to the brute force method. However, the simulation of a basic scenario demonstrates that additional optimization techniques are required for a simulation faster than real-time.},

  Abstract                 = {The standard benefit of modeling pedestrian streams is the ability to quantify and understand flow patterns, which can be helpful to avoid some potentially dangerous situations. Here we show that the most basic features of pedestrian dynamics can be put on a unifying theoretical basis, which is provided by the constructal law. This law states that every flow system evolves in time so that it develops the flow architecture that maximizes flow access under the constraints posed to the flow. In this Letter, we develop a model of pedestrian streams that accounts for the influence of pedestrian density. The constructal law is invoked in order to quantify both the so-called optimal level of service and system capacity for pedestrian streams.},

autonomous robotic units in a manufacturing environment with obstacles
where the robotic units have to be assigned to manufacturing targets in
a cost effective way, is achieved by using two fundamental principles of
nature. First, the selection behavior of modes is used which appears in
pattern formation of physical, chemical and biological systems. Coupled
selection equations based on these pattern formation principles can be used
as dynamical system approach to assignment problems. These differential
equations guarantee feasibility of the obtained solutions which is of great
importance in industrial applications. Second, a model of behavioral forces
is used, which has been successfully applied to describe self-organized
crowd behavior of pedestrians. This novel approach includes collision
avoidance as well as error resistivity. In particular, in systems where
failures are of concern, the suggested approach outperforms conventional
methods in covering up for sudden external changes like breakdowns
of some robotic units. The capability of this system is demonstrated in
computer simulations.},

Since pedestrian traffic cannot be restricted in some specified streets, some measures for pedestrian have to be taken everywhere in urban areas. This research describes a way to evaluate ordinary sidewalks, and two different methods are proposed. One is an evaluation based on pedestrian behaviour and the other is an evaluation based on pedestrian opinion. Using the indices of pedestrian density and sidewalk width, the authors can estimate the level of service of sidewalk usage. But generally speaking, since it is not often that a sidewalk is insufficient to deal with pedestrian flow, another approach is necessary for its evaluation, that is, pedestrian awareness of sidewalks must be taken into account. The former method is recommended for all sidewalks, especially with comparatively heavy pedestrian traffic, and the latter method is recommended for ones with light pedestrian traffic.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Passenger and freight transport are responsible for nearly a quarter of global primary energy use and energy related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Given the rapid rise in transport in industrializing countries, particularly China and India, this fraction is expected to increase in the coming decades. In the context of the need to reduce transport energy and \{GHG\} emissions, this paper addresses the following question: Should most of our efforts to reduce transport energy use and \{GHG\} emissions concentrate on reducing emissions (or energy) per unit of transport task (e.g. kg CO2-equivalent per passenger-km), or should we rather focus on reducing the passenger transport task itself? In addressing this question we limit our examination to surface passenger transport, since this makes up a significant proportion of all transport \{GHG\} emissions. We show by consideration of the available literature that it is most unlikely that technical solutions alone can deliver anywhere near the reductions needed. We then examine proposed non-technical solutions and conclude that major transport policy changes that reduce passenger travel levels themselves will be most effective in producing timely and deep transport emission cuts in existing economies. We end by discussing the prospect for these approaches in the transport sector and the broader economic consequences. },

The characteristics measured included walking speed, flow, and density for sidewalks of varying widths. Comparisons are made with results from Calgary, Canada, and from other Asian studies. The findings indicate that Asian speeds for all groups are significantly lower than those observed in Calgary, Canada. Implications of the findings with respect to the technological transfer of pedestrian planning techniques between the two countries are also discussed. The differences in pedestrian characteristics are caused not only by differences in speed, flow, and density relationships, but also by cultural differences. Problems common to both countries are lack of pedestrian data and difficulties involved in collecting pedestrian data. Suggestions concerning low-cost methods of updating pedestrian count data are provided.},

  Abstract                 = {Qu’elle soit composée de piétons dans une rue commerçante, de supporters quittant un
stade, ou de pèlerins à La Mecque, une foule humaine constitue un système dont la dyna-
mique collective est difficile à appréhender. En effet, au même titre qu’un banc de poissons ou
une colonie de fourmis, un groupe de piétons en déplacement est un exemple de système com-
plexe, dont les propriétés reposent en grande partie sur des processus d’auto-organisation.
Alors que ces processus ont fait l’objet d’un nombre important d’études dans les sociétés
animales, les mécanismes qui sous-tendent la dynamique des foules humaines restent peu
connus et sont le plus souvent étudiés de manière qualitative.
Ce travail de thèse est une analyse des mécanismes qui régissent les mouvements d’une
foule. En combinant étroitement observations en milieu naturel, expérimentations contrôlées
et modélisation mathématique, nous avons mené une étude approfondie du comportement
des individus dans une foule, de la dynamique globale du système, et du lien qui unit ces
deux niveaux d’observation.
La réalisation d’expériences contrôlées impliquant des piétons en interaction nous a per-
mis de caractériser les propriétés du comportement d’évitement, et son rôle dans l’émergence
de certaines structures collectives. Nos résultats mettent en évidence l’existence d’un biais
comportemental durant la manoeuvre d’évitement. Celui-ci est amplifié dans un contexte
collectif et joue un rôle structurant dans le phénomène de formation de files. Nous nous
sommes également intéressés aux interactions sociales qui gouvernent le comportement des
piétons se déplaçant en groupe. À l’aide d’observations réalisées en milieu urbain, nous
avons cherché à comprendre le rôle de ces interactions dans la configuration de marche des
groupes de piétons et leur influence sur l’efficacité globale du trafic. Enfin, nous proposons
une nouvelle approche de modélisation basée sur de simples heuristiques comportementales
s’appuyant sur le champ visuel des piétons.
Nos travaux permettent d’envisager une meilleure évaluation du trafic piétonnier en
condition urbaine et ouvrent de nouvelles pistes de recherches pour l’étude d’autres formes
de comportements collectifs dans notre société.},

  Abstract                 = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>A crowd of pedestrians is a complex system that exhibits a rich variety of self-organized collective behaviours. For instance, when two flows of people are walking in opposite directions in a crowded street, pedestrians spontaneously share the available space by forming lanes of uniform walking directions. This Ã¢Â€Âœpedestrian highwayÃ¢Â€Â� is a typical example of self-organized functional pattern, as it increases the traffic efficiency with no need of external control. In this work, we have conducted a series of laboratory experiments to determine the behavioral mechanisms underlying this pattern. In contrast to previous theoretical predictions, we found that the traffic organization actually alternates in time between well-organized and disorganized states. Our results demonstrate that this unstable dynamics is due to interactions between people walking faster and slower than the average speed of the crowd. While the traffic efficiency is maximized when everybody walks at the same speed, crowd heterogeneity reduces the collective benefits provided by the traffic segregation. This work is a step ahead in understanding the mechanisms of crowd self-organization, and opens the way for the elaboration of management strategies bound to promote smart collective behaviors.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {In animal societies as well as in human crowds, many observed collective behaviours result from selforganized processes based on local interactions among individuals. However, models of crowd dynamics are still lacking a systematic individual-level experimental verification, and the local mechanisms underlying the formation of collective patterns are not yet known in detail. We have conducted a set of well-controlled experiments with pedestrians performing simple avoidance tasks in order to determine the laws ruling their behaviour during interactions. The analysis of the large trajectory dataset was used to compute a behavioural map that describes the average change of the direction and speed of a pedestrian for various interaction distances and angles. The experimental results reveal features of the decision process when pedestrians choose the side on which they evade, and show a side preference that is amplified by mutual interactions. The predictions of a binary interaction model based on the above findings were then compared with bidirectional flows of people recorded in a crowded street. Simulations generate two asymmetric lanes with opposite directions of motion, in quantitative agreement with our empirical observations. The knowledge of pedestrian behavioural laws is an important step ahead in the understanding of the underlying dynamics of crowd behaviour and allows for reliable predictions of collective pedestrian movements under natural conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {With the increasing size and frequency of mass events, the study of crowd disasters and the simulation of pedestrian flows have become important research areas. However, even successful modeling approaches such as those inspired by Newtonian force models are still not fully consistent with empirical observations and are sometimes hard to calibrate. Here, a cognitive science approach is proposed, which is based on behavioral heuristics. We suggest that, guided by visual information, namely the distance of obstructions in candidate lines of sight, pedestrians apply two simple cognitive procedures to adapt their walking speeds and directions. Although simpler than previous approaches, this model predicts individual trajectories and collective patterns of motion in good quantitative agreement with a large variety of empirical and experimental data. This model predicts the emergence of self-organization phenomena, such as the spontaneous formation of unidirectional lanes or stop-and-go waves. Moreover, the combination of pedestrian heuristics with body collisions generates crowd turbulence at extreme densities-a phenomenon that has been observed during recent crowd disasters. By proposing an integrated treatment of simultaneous interactions between multiple individuals, our approach overcomes limitations of current physics-inspired pair interaction models. Understanding crowd dynamics through cognitive heuristics is therefore not only crucial for a better preparation of safe mass events. It also clears the way for a more realistic modeling of collective social behaviors, in particular of human crowds and biological swarms. Furthermore, our behavioral heuristics may serve to improve the navigation of autonomous robots.},

  Abstract                 = {Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behavior consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute mediumscale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its "non-aerodynamic" shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.},

In some cases, the design of the cabin interior has been cited as a mitigating factor in delayed cabin egress. The research described in this article formed the first stage of a longitudinal program of research designed to address these concerns and to identify means by which emergency evacuations may be optimized. A series of full-scale evacuation simulations were performed in which the cabin design was systematically varied and which offered financial incentives to motivate volunteers to compete. Additionally, a number of similar evacuations without the financial incentive were carried out to simulate evacuations performed in less life-threatening circumstances. The results revealed that blockages adjacent to the exits were more likely to occur when space was at a minimum, although serious blockages occurred only when volunteers were competing with one another. Evacuation rates were also found to be affected by aircraft or cabin configurational changes. Those evacuations requiring that volunteers pass through the aperture by the midcabin bulkheads were found to be accelerated by an increase in the aperture width. This was also true for evacuations through a Type III emergency exit, up to a point beyond which rates were found to decline. Recommendations for optimum configurations were made on the basis of these results.},

Although this discussion does not cover recent work in other modes used in evacuation such as air, rail, and pedestrian, this paper does highlight recent interdisciplinary modeling work in evacuation to help bridge the gap between the behavioral sciences and engineering and the application of emerging techniques for the verification, validation, and calibration of models. The manuscript also calls attention to special considerations and logistical difficulties, which have received limited attention to date. In addition to these concerns, the following future directions are discussed: further interdisciplinary efforts, including incorporating the medical community; using new technologies for communication of warnings and traffic condition information, data collection, and increased modeling resolution and confidence; using real-time information; and further model refinements and validation.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamische Ansteuerungen gebäudetechnischer Brandschutzeinrichtungen
Gebäudetechnische Brandschutzeinrichtungen spielen bei der Bewältigung von Herausforde-
rungen der Brandsicherheit eine zunehmend wichtigere Rolle. Aufgrund steigender Anforde-
rungen, stetiger technischer Entwicklungen, Vernetzungen und Interaktionen von gebäude-
technischen Brandschutzeinrichtungen untereinander und mit anderen Systemen steigt auch
die Komplexität des Gesamtsystems technischer Anlagen von Gebäuden.
Bislang werden gebäudetechnische Brandschutzeinrichtungen überwiegend als autarke An-
lagen geplant, errichtet, geprü昀 und betrieben. Brandfallsteuerungen solcher Anlagen sind
überwiegend statischer Natur und berücksichtigen in der Regel weder die dynamische Natur
eines Brandereignisses noch Interaktionen zwischen Anlagen. Damit wird das Potential von
gebäudetechnischen Brandschutzeinrichtungen nicht ausgeschöp昀.
Die vorliegende Arbeit zeigt Wege, wie gebäudetechnische Brandschutzeinrichtungen sicher
gestaltet und dynamisch gesteuert werden können, um adäquat auf das dynamische Brandge-
schehen zu reagieren. Hierzu wird ein Modell vorgestellt, mithilfe dessen gebäudetechnische
Brandschutzeinrichtungen als ein Gesamtsystem geplant werden können.
Dynamic Controls of Fire Protection Systems
Fire protection systems play an increasingly important role in resolving challenges to 昀re safety.
Due to increasing demands, continuous technical development, networking and interactions
of 昀re protection systems with each other and other systems, also rises the complexity of these
systems.
Up to now 昀re protection systems are primarily designed, built, tested and operated or control-
led as stand-alone systems. 吀e 昀re protection control systems of such systems are therefore
predominantly of a static nature and do not take into account the dynamic nature of the 昀re or
the interactions of systems. 吀us, the potential of 昀re protection systems is not fully realized.
吀is thesis shows ways in which 昀re protection systems can be built safely and controlled
dynamically to respond adequately to the dynamic 昀re events. For this purpose a model is
presented for the planning of fully comprehensive 昀re protection systems.},

We study the jamming and freezing transitions when pedestrian density increases. We show that the dynamical phase transitions occur at three stages with increasing density. There exist four traffic states: the free traffic, jammed traffic 1, jammed traffic 2, and frozen state. At the frozen state, all pedestrians stop by preventing from going ahead each other. At three transitions, the pedestrian flow changes from the free traffic through the jammed traffic 1 and jammed traffic 2, to the frozen state.},

  Abstract                 = {Traffic flow is a kind of many-body system of strongly interacting vehicles. Traffic jams are a typical signature of the complex behaviour of vehicular traffic. Various models are presented聽to understand the rich variety of physical phenomena exhibited by traffic. Analytical and numerical techniques are applied to study these models. Particularly, we present detailed results obtained mainly from the microscopic car-following models. A typical phenomenon is the dynamical jamming transition from the free traffic (FT) at low density to the congested traffic at high density. The jamming transition exhibits the phase diagram similar to a conventional gas-liquid phase transition:聽the FT and congested traffic correspond to the gas and liquid phases, respectively. The dynamical transition is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation for the phase transition. The jamming transition curve is given by the spinodal line. The metastability exists in the region between the spinodal and phase separation lines. The jams in the congested traffic reveal various density waves. Some of these density waves show typical nonlinear waves such as soliton, triangular shock and kink. The density waves are described by the nonlinear wave equations:聽the Korteweg-de-Vries (KdV) equation, the Burgers equation and the Modified KdV equation. Subjects like the traffic flow such as bus-route system and pedestrian flow are touched as well. The bus-route system with many buses exhibits the bunching transition where buses bunch together with proceeding ahead. Such dynamic models as the car-following model are proposed to investigate the bunching transition and bus delay. A recurrent bus exhibits the dynamical transition between the delay and schedule-time phases. The delay transition is described in terms of the nonlinear map. The pedestrian flow also reveals the jamming transition from the free flow at low density to the clogging at high density. Some models are presented to study the pedestrian flow. When聽the clogging occurs, the pedestrian flow shows the scaling behaviour.},

Here we present results of experiments inwhichtrack logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweightGPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics.We find a well-defined hierarchy amongflockmembers fromdata concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds' directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock
strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye-both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. Fromanevolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships are
consistently manifested.},

  Abstract                 = {For the first time in any U.S. model building code, the 1992 edition of the BOCA National Building Code requires residential stairs to have risers no greater than 7 inches and treads no less than 11 inches. Before 1992, the BOCA code specified 8Â¼-inch maximum riser heights and 9-inch minimum tread depths. This 7-11 geometry, as it is known, has the potential to influence housing costs significantly, particularly the cost of entry-level affordable housing.
The primary objective of this report is to assess the state of knowledge with regard to the role of riser and tread dimensions in accidental falls on residential stairways. A more specific purpose is to examine existing sources of data and research and to determine what they indicate about the safety performance of various stair geometries. The study, therefore, involved an examination of statistical data and a literature review. A secondary objective of the report is to identify other features or characteristics of stairs that potentially play a role in stair safety. Thus, the study also included a review of literature to identify other stair features or characteristics possibly related to
stair safety.
Section 2 of this report discusses stair geometry in general. Section 3 discusses the major sources of statistical information and reviews the research contained in the existing literature. Sections 4 and 5 present conclusions and recommendations. A brief description of other potential safety features of stairs is contained in Appendix A. For the readers convenience, two indices have been provided at the end of this work. The first is an index of the titles of all articles reviewed. The second is an index of authors' surnames, organizational names, acronyms, periodical names, and other terms frequently used in citations to the literature.

  Abstract                 = {A continuum model that describes a disordered, heterogeneous traffic stream is presented. Such systems are widely prevalent in developing countries where classical traffic models cannot be readily applied. The characteristics of such systems are unique since drivers of smaller vehicles exploit their maneuverability to move ahead through lateral gaps at lower speeds. At higher speeds, larger vehicles press their advantage of greater motive power. The traffic stream at the microscopic level is disordered and defines a porous medium. Each vehicle is considered to move through a series of pores defined by other vehicles. A speed-density relationship that explicitly considers the pore space distribution is presented. This captures the considerable dynamics between vehicle classes that are overlooked when all classes are converted to a reference class (usually Passenger Car Equivalents) as is traditionally done. Using a finite difference approximation scheme, traffic evolution for a two-class traffic stream is shown.},

  Abstract                 = {Large dense crowds show aggregate behavior with reduced individual freedom of movement. We present a novel, scalable approach for simulating such crowds, using a dual representation both as discrete agents and as a single continuous system. In the continuous setting, we introduce a novel variational constraint called unilateral incompressibility, to model the large-scale behavior of the crowd, and accelerate inter-agent collision avoidance in dense scenarios. This approach makes it possible to simulate very large, dense crowds composed of up to a hundred thousand agents at nearinteractive rates on desktop computers.},

The details of the experimental procedures and results are described. Comparisons are made with other studies, and conclusions drawn from the studies are presented. It was found that under certain conditions, bicycle flow can be treated as vehicular flow, and the findings are presented for maximum capacity of bicycle paths, their level of service, width of a cycle pathway, the radius of turn for a path, and grades.},

Substantial progress has been made in the quantitative understanding of complex systems, particularly since the 1980s, using a combination of basic theory, much of it derived from physics, and computer simulation. The subject is a broad one, drawing on techniques and ideas from a wide range of areas. Here, I give a selection of introductory resources, ranging from classic papers to recent books and reviews.},

Here, we present a simple and computationally efficient criterion for topological constraints, i.e., uncrossability of chains, in polymeric liquids using the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. No new length scales or forces are added. To demonstrate that this approach really prevents chain crossings, we study a melt of linear homopolymers. We show that for short chains the model correctly reproduces Rouse-like dynamics whereas for longer chains the dynamics becomes reptational as the chain length is increased-something that is not attainable using standard DPD or other coarse-grained soft potential methods.},

The results suggest that social influence is an important factor and that it becomes more important when the fire cue, e.g., the alarm, is unclear or uninformative. Results also indicate that social influence increases with decreasing distance between visitors. This result implies that individuals are influenced more by people who are close than by people

shortest distance to an exit door, in an arbitrary geometry of rooms is presented. The wall potential and contraction effect at a wide exit are also proposed in order to obtain realistic behavior near
corners and bottlenecks. These extensions are important for evacuation simulations, especially in the case of panics.},

  Abstract                 = {Models for the behavior of ants and pedestrians are studied in a unified way in this paper. Each ant follows pheromone put by preceding ants, hence creating a trail on the ground, while pedestrians also try to follow others in a crowd for efficient and safe walking. These following behaviors are incorporated in our stochastic models by using only local update rules for computational efficiency. It is demonstrated that the ant trail model shows a unusual non-monotonic dependence of the average speed of the ants on their density, which can be well analyzed by the zero-range process. We also show that this anomalous behavior is clearly observed in an experiment of multiple robots. Next, the relation between the ant trail model and the floor field model for studying evacuation dynamics of pedestrians is discussed. The latter is regarded as a two-dimensional generalization of the ant trail model, where the pheromone is replaced by footprints. It is shown from simulations that small perturbations to pedestrians will sometimes avoid congestion and hence allow safe evacuation.},

  Abstract                 = {Großveranstaltungen (Definition s.a. (16)) sind bei der Bev•lkerung sehr beliebt. Sie ziehen
immer mehr Besucher an, die Ereignisse, wie Volksfeste, Konzerte oder Fu€ballspiele,
erleben und teilen wollen. Die Konsequenz ist, dass bei solchen Veranstaltungen viele
Menschen auf engem Raum zusammenkommen. Ohne Informationen ‚ber die zu erwartende
Besucherzahl und das m•gliche Besucherverhalten ist eine erfolgreiche Planung solcher
Veranstaltungen und eine Kalkulation der Einsƒtze von Rettungskrƒften schwierig.
Die vfdb koordinierte zu diesem Thema von Mƒrz 2009 bis Februar 2011 ein
Forschungsprojekt im Rahmen des Sicherheitsforschungsprogramms der Bundesregierung.
Ziel des Projektes waren Planungsgrundlagen zur Verbesserung von Risikobewertungen,
Evakuierungsmodellen und Rettungskonzepten.
Spƒtestens seit der Loveparade in Duisburg ist das Risiko von Gro€veranstaltungen und
insbesondere die Thematik der Personendichten, der Personenstr•me und deren Lenkung und
das Crowd Management in den Fokus der Betrachtungen ger‚ckt. Diese Themen sind zwei
wichtige Aspekte in einer Gefƒhrdungsanalyse f‚r Gro€veranstaltungen. Die Analysen der
Personendichten und der Personenstr•me sind sowohl lokal f‚r begrenzte Rƒume als auch
‚bergreifend f‚r das gesamte Veranstaltungsgelƒnde einschlie€lich der Zu- und Abwege zu
betrachten.},

Several researches have studied pedestrian flow but experimental data are not enough. This paper focuses on comparison between experiment and simulation. Simulation is based on discrete element method with psychological effect and the experiment was conducted using mice with electric stimulus device. Agents of experiment are mice instead of human because of possibility of real casualties. Averaged velocity and total escape time are observed and results of simulation and experiment are qualitatively similar in practice. },

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study is the development of a computer simulation model for pedestrian movement in architectural and urban space. The characteristic of the model is the ability to visualize the movement of each pedestrian in a plan as an animation. So architects and designers can easily find and understand the problems in their designprojects.
In this model, the movement of each pedestrian is simulated by the motion of a magnetized object in a magnetic field. Positive magnetic pole is given to each pedestrian and obstacles like walls and columns. Negative magnetic pole is located at the goal of pedestrians. Each pedestrian moves to his goal by the attractive force caused by the negative magnetic pole at his goal, avoiding collisions with other pedestrians and obstacles by repulsive forces caused by the positive magnetic poles.
The effectiveness of the simulation model is shown by the following two kinds of simulation examples.
(1) Evacuation from an office building
 In this model pedestrians walk along the route from each starting point to the exit in case of evacuation. The example shows the places where stagnations and heavy congestions occur, and designers can see if the evacuation routes are appropriate.
(2) Movement of pedestrians in queue spaces
 Three types of queuing behavior is classified in this model: movement in front of counters, movement passing through ratches, and movement of getting on and off in elevator halls. Simulation examples in a railway station and in a main floor of a resort hotel are shown where several kinds of queue spaces are included and complicated movements of hundreds of pedestrians occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Annotating unlabeled motion captures plays an important role in Computer Animation for motion analysis and motion
edition purposes. Locomotion is a difficult case study as all the limbs of the human body are involved whereas a low-
dimensional global motion is performed. The oscillatory nature of the locomotion makes difficult the distinction between
straight steps and turning ones, especially for subtle orientation changes. In this paper we propose to geometrically model the
center of mass trajectory during locomotion as a C1 -continuous circular arcs sequence. Our model accurately analyzes the
global motion into the velocity-curvature space. An experimental study demonstrates that an invariant law links curvature
and velocity during straight walk. We finally illustrate how the resulting law can be used for annotation purposes: any
unlabeled motion captured walk can be transformed into an annotated sequence of straight and turning steps. Several
examples demonstrate the robustness of our approach and give comparison with classical threshold-based techniques.},

We found that, unlike other animals escaping under life-and-death conditions and pedestrian simulations, ants do not produce a higher density zone near the exit door. Instead, ants are uniformly distributed over the available space allowing for efficient evacuations. Consequently, the faster-is-slower effect observed in ants (Soria et al., 2012) is clearly of a different nature to that predicted by de social force model. In the case of ants, the minimum evacuation time is correlated with the lower probability of taking backward steps. Thus, as biological model ants have important differences that make their use inadvisable for the design of human facilities. },

  Abstract                 = {We propose and document the evidence for an analogy between the dynamics of granular counter-flows in the presence of bottlenecks or restrictions and financial price formation processes. Using extensive simulations, we find that the counter-flows of simulated pedestrians through a door display many stylized facts observed in financial markets when the density around the door is compared with the logarithm of the price. The stylized properties are present already when the agents in the pedestrian model are assumed to display a zero-intelligent behavior. If agents are given decision-making capacity and adapt to partially follow the majority, periods of herding behavior may additionally occur. This generates the very slow decay of the autocorrelation of absolute return due to an intermittent dynamics. Our finding suggest that the stylized facts in the fluctuations of the financial prices result from a competition of two groups with opposite interests in the presence of a constraint funneling the flow of transactions to a narrow band of prices.},

We propose a novel formulation to blend input guidance fields to create singularity-free, goal-directed navigation fields. Our method can be easily combined with most current local collision-avoidance methods and we use two such methods as examples to highlight the potential of our approach. We illustrate its performance on several simulation scenarios.},

Wide-angle photographs, especially those shot with flash lighting, do not depict adequately what a fall victim saw immediately prior to the critical misstep. A preferred technique is to make a series of many photographs, all taken from a fixed position using fixed exposure settings and a normal-perspective lens. A series of individual photographs is then assembled into a doubly-curved panorama which best represents a complete visual field with preservation of correct perspective for the environment faced by a falling person at the time of the initiating misstep. Presented here is one fall safety expert's experience with the long-term use of such panoramas within a litigation context in North America. The intention is to expand use of such visual documentation techniques in studies of missteps and falls associated with stairs and other pedestrian facilities.},

Some developments began nationally in the USA. Others, in the City of New York, recommended major regulatory changes for both existing and new high-rise buildings. Some of these improve safety of exit stairways, especially under conditions when lighting fails. Measures needed to reduce the incidence and severity of falls -- both in individual and crowd movement conditions -- will also have implications for evacuation efficiency. Generally, the design, performance, retrofit and management of evacuation and means of egress/escape have been inadequately examined through systematic research, including disaster investigations. Perhaps one legacy of the World Trade Center disaster will be a major change to this situation. This paper describes some of the developments that could make a difference.},

  Abstract                 = {Two major demographic changes are affecting many countries. First identified was the "graying" of the population, more correctly, the growing proportion of the population having an advanced age, say 65 years. Second is the relatively recently recognized set of changes sometimes characterized (incompletely) as the "obesity epidemic" which is affecting all ages. The second demographic change has primary characteristics such as increased body mass, increased size (especially girth), and decreased physical fitness. Secondary characteristics are various health effects, some of which were formerly more associated with aging; these include hypertension, type 2 diabetes, joint deterioration, and some mental performance changes as well as movement performance changes including reduced walking speed and endurance. These changes could, in turn, affect walking-related fall and injury propensity plus the ability to cope with the physical demands of sustained crowd movement, for example, associated with evacuation of major facilities including high-occupancy buildings such as sports venues and high-rise structures. The time, as well as necessary organizational preparedness, required to accomplish such relatively demanding crowd movement will increase with these demographic changes. In terms of needed design improvements, consideration must now be given to increasing sidewalk and passageway width -- especially stairways -- to accommodate enlarged lateral dimensions of people as well as increased lateral sway behavior exacerbated with relatively slow movement speeds. Consideration must also be given to improving the usability of stairs, including lower step height, and increased provision of rest areas which, for high-rise building evacuations, might dictate increased stair landing sizes.},

  Abstract                 = {Large portions of the current technology of means of egress performance are based on studies performed decades ago in a relatively small number of contexts. The current validity of such studies, in all contexts, is now being critically questioned by some researchers -- namely Pauls and Fruin -- who were responsible for much of the original work. Chief among reasons for this is the apparent, rapidly reducing movement capability of people in most areas of the world due to demographic changes, especially reduced fitness levels brought on by increasingly sedentary lifestyles, increased body size and increased body weight. The term, "obesity epidemic," is a commonly applied label for the demographic changes, however, this tends to understate or misrepresent the problem as being merely one of excess weight. It is not. Neither is the problem solely one of reduced building occupant capabilities due, in part, to reduced individual and societal motivation plus physiological condition. Paralleling the deterioration of occupant performance capabilities is an apparent failure within safety professions -- more specifically fire protection engineering -- that, in this author's opinion, are not responding sufficiently in either a reactive or proactive fashion. Fire protection engineers and related safety plus design professionals, for example, are neither utilizing existing research properly nor facilitating future research needed to establish realistic expectations of egress performance for buildings.},

Air steps, for example, are a major source of pedestrian injuries, which can be serious, even in cases where there is not an ensuing to the walking surface. One consequence of the latter is that such pedestrian problems get relatively little attention at the "research" end of the spectrum addressed in "Slips, Trips and Falls" conferences held to date and planned for August 2007. At the "practice" end there are also shortcomings in standards, codes and regulations as well as guides and other practice-oriented materials that could do much more to prevent or mitigate the problems. Examples, drawn from litigation-based consulting practice -- for example in relation to defective sidewalks and stairs, demonstrate how and why such other missteps occur and what can be done improve safety.},

Specific requirements for various environmental factors, including slip resistance of walking surfaces, stair step geometry, lighting, handrails and occupancy context, were identified and rated on an A to F scale for both their technical quality and the extent of enforcement or application. Dwellings and other buildings were separately rated. Gaps in some codes' coverage of fall-related environmental factors were identified. Generally, deficiencies of building codes in relation to fall prevention and mitigation arise during development, adoption and enforcement stages of the building regulatory processes. Also, until there is a better awareness by authorities and others of epidemiological and etiological aspects of the fallrelated injury problem, the roles of codes will be less than fully effective.},

This raises important questions about the quality of the information bases utilized by various participants. One example relates to guidance on elimination (or mitigation) of dangers associated with scatter/throw rugs in homes, especially when encountered by people whose gait is altered due to aging. Is the hazard one of tripping or slipping or both? What are the relevant biomechanics? What are the best interventions? Another example is provision of handrails. How meaningful is recommendation for a "sturdy" handrail for stairs? Does marking of only certain stair step nosings (such as top and bottom nosings) make the stair safer or could it exacerbate usability and safety problems? How meaningful are recommendations to use non-slip materials? These questions are explored in two ways; first in
relation to technical aspects within the expertise of those with a biomechanics or, more generally, ergonomics; and, secondly, in relation to the goals and methods of safety advocates -- in the US, UK and Canada -- working on a relatively small set of uncomplicated set of dos and don'ts directed to professionals and ordinary consumers.},

Emphasis is on the USA but some developments are noted for Canada and the UK. The focus is on model codes, national standards plus adopted regulations and the influences of ergonomics plus public health competing with building industry influences, notably homebuilders. The degree of progress or setback is directly related to specific model code development policies and procedures employed -- especially in relation to
openness, fairness and comprehensive, multidisciplinary participation -- as well as the adoption and enforcement process used to apply requirements to actual design and construction. Secondarily, the limited amount of research on safety and usability of stairways is a factor. A third major factor is the propensity of both designers and other construction professionals, as well as ordinary building users, to assume -- partly in error -- that building codes, standards and regulations are based on up-to-date science and technology as well as public health principles to a sufficient extent that they can be
relied upon to achieve reasonable safety and usability of the built environment. Affecting all these factors strongly is a traditional belief, especially in the building industry, that homes should be designed and constructed to significantly lower functional standards than applied to other buildings despite the greater -- and growing needs -- of home users.},

Later, when research funding in this field was almost eliminated, work was performed in a private-sector consulting capacity in the U.S. Here insights were applied from earlier research as well as being drawn from specific fatal fire investigations performed to assist with litigation. Two case studies from such litigation after apartment building fires are described; one in a high-rise building, the other in a low-rise building. A continuing theme in this history of nearly three decades of personal professional interest in fire-related human behaviour is the importance of documenting -- at a minimum -- the spatial and temporal aspects of human behaviour in fire incidents and related egress activity. Such descriptive information on space and time factors is a key to understanding eventually why certain behaviour occurs and how it can be more safely accommodated in building regulation, management and design, including performance-based design.},

by elevators (lifts). The case of the total evacuation of the two 110-story towers in the World Trade Center, New York City, is discussed to illustrate some possible flaws in our approaches to, understanding of, and dependence on vertical evacuation. Although that evacuation, on February 26, 1993, entailed on the order of 100,000 person-hours of occupant evacuation activity, relatively little systematic study has been conducted of what actually occurred.

Criticisms of this lane model were presented separately by the authors as early as about 1970 and improved bases for minimum width determination were also presented. Currently, even the improved bases for minimum stair width -- based on the authors' early work -- need to be updated for stair user demographics and other factors that have changed in recent decades. Three types of crowd flow are considered; coherent flow, overtaking movement, and counterflow. All of these occurred in the evacuations of the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001. Partly as a result of the latter incident,
counterflow has recently received particular attention in some US standards and building code-change deliberations that led to a minor increase -- from 1120 mm to 1422 mm (44 in. to 56 in.) in minimum, nominal exit stair width requirements for certain occupancy conditions. Completing an examination of past, current and future criteria for setting minimum stair width, the authors provide suggestions for studies that will help provide significantly improved bases for such widths in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {A paradigm shift, resisted for decades, occurred in March 2004 after an international workshop on use of elevators during fires in buildings. Along with enhanced use of elevators by firefighters, the paradigm shift was a widely supported decision to move toward use of elevators for evacuation of building occupants in fires. Subsequently, a series of working meetings was held to conduct multidisciplinary hazard analyses by task groups organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the secretariat for the US national elevator standard, ANSI/ASME A17.1. Numerous ergonomic (human factors) issues are raised but they are not yet well addressed. Issues include staffing, training, signage, communication generally, systems operations and, most generally, how to both transition from -- and co-exist with -- traditional exit stairway-based systems for occupant egress from buildings. Within several ASME-hosted working meetings to date, the hazard analyses have identified, in an iterative fashion, numerous hazards, causes/triggers, incidents/effects, corrective actions and residual hazards. Key to a balanced completion of the hazard analysis process -- and standards revisions and eventual implementation in actual buildings -- is greater participation of ergonomists so that not only can human capabilities be fairly addressed, but vulnerabilities of other system components can be identified as well.},

Our existing crowd simulation system (MACES) performs high level wayfinding to explore unknown environments and obtain a cognitive map for navigation purposes, in addition to dealing with low level motion within each room based on social forces. Communication and roles are added to achieve individualistic behaviors and a realistic way to spread information about the environment. To expand the range of realistic human behaviors, we use a system (PMFserv) that implements human behavior models from a range of ability, stress, emotion, decision theoretic and motivation sources. An architecture is proposed that combines and integrates MACES and PMFserv to add validated agent behaviors to crowd simulations.},

However, this strategy leads to an aggregated phenomenon where the agents move very slow. Therefore, we further introduce a certain repulsion, which results in both faster consensus and longer safe distance among agents, and thus provides a powerful mechanism for collective motions in biological and technological multi-agent systems.},

In this presentation, we report the study of the conformation of congestion in a “T” intersection by using a cellular automata procedure with multi-floor fields. By using the multi-floor fields, we can mimic the pedestrian flow from several entrances to different exits firstly, and we can simulate the different pedestrian speed by changing the controlling parameter.

  Abstract                 = {We study the efficacy of allelomimesis as an escape strategy of mobile agents (pedestrians) that aim to leave a two-exit room within the shortest possible time. Allelomimesis is the act of copying one's kindred neighbors. To escape an agent employs one of the following strategies: (1) It chooses its own route independently (non-copying, alpha=0), (2) It imitates the actions of its neighbors at all times (blind copying, alpha =1), or (3) It either copies or acts independently according to a certain probability that is set by the copying parameter alpha(0<alpha<1). Not more than one agent could occupy a given room location. An agent's knowledge of the two exit locations is set by its information content beta(0<beta<1). When left alone, an agent with complete knowledge of the exit whereabouts (beta=1) always takes the shortest possible path to an exit. We obtain plots of the (group) evacuation time T and exit throughput Q as functions of alpha and beta for cases where the two exits are near (on same room side) and far (on opposite sides of room) from each other. For an isolated agent, T is inversely proportional to beta. The chances of escape for an isolated agent with beta less-than-or-equals, slant0.2 are higher with adjacent exits. However, for an agent with beta>0.4 the chance is better with opposite exits. In a highly occupied room (occupancy rate R = 80%) with adjacent exits, agents with beta>0.8 escape more quickly if they employ a mixed strategy of copying and non-copying (0.4<alpha<0.6). On the other hand, blind copying (alpha \approx 1) gives agents with beta<.01 a better chance of escaping from the same room. For the same alpha and R values, opposite exits allow faster evacuation for agents with beta<0.1 due to the likelihood of streaming and the lower probability of exit clogging. Streaming indicates an efficient utilization of an exit and it happens when the arcs that are formed are smaller and arch interference is less likely. Allelomimesis provides a simple yet versatile mechanism for studying the egress behavior of confined crowds in a multi-exit room.},

The method is called 'start of evacuation motion' analysis and is based on logic diagrams called continuous and single value networks (Process Safety Prog. 20 (2001) 1-10). The logic diagrams have shown to be a very powerful tool to analyze the cognitive aspects of human beings during a fire emergency situation.

  Abstract                 = {In order to analyse the behaviour of pedestrians at the very fine scale, while moving along the streets, in open spaces or inside a building, simulation modelling becomes an essential tool. In these spatial environments, in the presence of unusual demand flows, simulation requires the ability to model the local dynamics of individual decision making and behaviour, which is strongly affected by the geometry, randomness, social preferences, local and collective behaviour of other individuals. The dynamics of people visiting and evacuating a museum offers an excellent case study along this line. In this paper we realize an agent-based simulation of the Castello Ursino museum in Catania (Italy), evaluating its carrying capacity in terms of both satisfaction of the visitors in regime of normal fruition and their safety under alarm conditions.},

Raumkontinuierliche Modelle sind ein Versuch dieses komplexe System zu simulieren. Es werden in dieser Arbeit verschiedene ModellierungsansÃ¤tze verfolgt. Bei der Entwicklung eines Modells wird mit dem einfachsten Fall begonnen. Wenn ein Modell die Wirklichkeit fÃ¼r diesen Fall quantitativ und qualitativ abbildet, kann es spÃ¤ter auch auf kompliziertere zweidimensionale Gegebenheiten erweitert werden. Als einfachsten Fall erhÃ¤lt man durch Reduktion der Freiheitsgrade die Bewegung entlang einer Linie.

In dieser Arbeit werden verschiedene Kriterien vorgestellt, die ein Modell erfÃ¼llen sollte. Einerseits muss die Beziehung zwischen Geschwindigkeit und Dichte richtig wiedergegeben werden. Diese Anforderung ist erfÃ¼llt, wenn die modellierten Daten das Fundamentaldiagramm der empirischen Daten rekonstruieren.

Andererseits ist das Auftreten von kollektiven PhÃ¤nomenen zu reproduzieren: d. h. das Modell sollte Stauwellen erzeugen, wie sie in der RealitÃ¤t beobachtet werden. ZusÃ¤tzlich soll der Rechenzeitbedarf minimiert werden, so dass zu einem spÃ¤teren Zeitpunkt groÃŸe Geometrien mit mehreren Tausend FuÃŸgÃ¤ngern simuliert werden kÃ¶nnen.

FÃ¼nf verschiedene raumkontinuierliche Modelle sind auf diese Kriterien hin getestet worden. Mit drei von ihnen ist es mÃ¶glich ein Fundamentaldiagramm Ã¤hnlich dem der empirischen Daten zu rekonstruieren. Jedoch kann nur ein Modell Stauwellen erzeugen. 


The applications of pedestrians dynamics range from safety concepts for mass events to the planning of towns with respect to pedestrians' comfort. Models, which are continuous in space, are one possibility to simulate this comlex system. In this work we follow several modeling approaches. For model development, we prefer to start with the simplest case. If the model is able to reproduce the reality quantitatively and qualitatively, it is possible to adapt it to more complex two-dimensional conditions. By delimiting the degrees of freedom, we obtain single lane movement.

A realistic model of pedestrian dynamics has to meet several criteria. On the one hand, the relation between velocity and density has to be described correctly. This requirement is fulfilled, if the modeled data reproduce the fundamental diagram of the empirical data. On the other hand, the occurence of collective phenomena, like stop-and-go waves as they are observed in reality, should be reproduced. In the future our goal is to simulate large geometries with several tens of thousands pedestrians, thus the computing time should be kept to a minimum.

Five different continuous space models were tested under these criteria. Three of them are able to create a fundamental diagram in good agreement with the empirical one. But only one of these three models could correctly reproduce stop-and-go waves.},

The velocity density relation using measurements on a 'microscopic' scale shows the coexistence of two phases at one density. These data are used to calibrate and verify a spatially continuous model. Several criteria are chosen that a model has to satisfy: firstly we investigated the fundamental diagram (velocity versus density) using different measurement methods. Furthermore the trajectories are compared to the occurrence of stop-and-go waves qualitatively. Finally we checked the distribution of the velocities at fixed density against the experimental one. The adaptive velocity model introduced satisfies these criteria well.},

Here, we investigated how this anticipatory strategy is modified whilst varying visual conditions (Experiment 1) and walking speed (Experiment 2). Exp. 1 showed similar anticipatory behaviour when walking with or without vision. Exp. 2 (that varied walking speed; eyes open) showed that the head started to deviate at a constant distance rather than at a constant time to the corner. The results appear inconsistent with optic flow theories of the guidance of walking direction and might highlight the role of landmarks and/or egocentric direction in anticipatory orienting behaviour. },

This paper reviews the state of the art in the analysis of route choice behavior within the discrete choice modeling framework. The review covers both choice set generation and choice process, since present research directions show growing interest in understanding the role of choice set size and composition on model estimation and flow prediction, while past research directions illustrate larger efforts toward the enhancement of stochastic route choice models rather than toward the development of realistic choice set generation methods. This paper also envisions future research directions toward the improvement in amount and quality of collected data, the consideration of the latent nature of the set of alternatives, the definition of route relevance and choice set efficiency measures, the specification of models able to contextually account for taste heterogeneity and substitution patterns, and the adoption of random constraint approaches to represent jointly choice set formation and choice process. },

not been incorporated by existing crowd simulation models. Motivated by the need of group modeling for crowd behavior simulation, this paper presents a unified and welldefined
framework for modeling the structure aspect of different groups in pedestrian crowds. Both intra-group structure and inter-group relationships are considered and their effects on the crowd behavior are modeled. Based on this framework, an agent-based crowd simulation system is developed and crowd behavior simulations using two different group structures are presented. The simulation results show that the developed framework allows different group structures to be easily modeled. Besides, different group sizes, intragroup structures and inter-group relationships can have significant impacts on crowd behaviors.},

The market imposes new demands for quality and safety. Today, fire protection forms an integral part of a modern strategy for survival and competitiveness.
This guideline is primarily intended for those responsible for safety in companies and organisations. It is also addressed to the rescue services, consultants, safety companies etc so that, in the course of their work, they may be able to help companies and organisations to increase the levels of fire safety.
The proposals within this guideline have been produced by the AIAS - Associazione professionale Italiana Ambiente e Sicurezza and the author is Tiziano Zuccaro from Italy.
This guideline has been compiled by Guidelines Commission and adopted by all fire protection associations in the Confederation of Fire Protection Associations Europe.
These guidelines reflect best practice developed by the countries of CFPA Europe. Where the guidelines and national requirement conflict, national requirements must apply.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic forces induced by humans walking change simultaneously in time and space, being random in nature and varying considerably not only between different people but also for a single individual who cannot repeat two identical steps. Since these important aspects of walking forces have not been adequately researched in the past, the corresponding lack of knowledge has reflected badly on the quality of their mathematical models used in vibration assessments of pedestrian structures such as footbridges, staircases and floors. To develop better force models which can be used with more confidence in the structural design, an adequate experimental and analytical approach must be taken to account for their complexity. This paper is the most comprehensive review published to date, of 270 references dealing with different experimental and analytical characterizations of human walking loading. The source of dynamic human-induced forces is in fact in the body motion. To date, human motion has attracted a lot of interest in many scientific branches, particularly in medical and sports science, bioengineering, robotics, and space flight programs. Other fields include biologists of various kinds, physiologists, anthropologists, computer scientists (graphics and animation), human factors and ergonomists, etc. It resulted in technologically advanced tools that can help understanding the human movement in more detail. Therefore, in addition to traditional direct force measurements utilizing a force plate and an instrumented treadmill, this review also introduces methods for indirect measurement of time-varying records of walking forces via combination of visual motion tracking (imaging) data and known body mass distribution. The review is therefore an interdisciplinary article that bridges the gaps between biomechanics of human gait and civil engineering dynamics. Finally, the key reason for undertaking this review is the fact that humanâ€“structure dynamic interaction and pedestrian synchronization when walking on more or less perceptibly moving structures are increasingly giving serious cause for concern in vibration serviceability design. There is a considerable uncertainty about how excessive structural vibrations modify walking and hence affect pedestrian-induced forces, significantly in many cases.

  Abstract                 = {The asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP) has attracted a lot of interest not on l y because of its many applications, e.g., in the context of the kinetics of biopolymerization and traffic flow theory, but also because it is a paradigmatic model for nonequilibrium systems. Here we study the ASEP for different types of updates, namely random-sequential, sequential, sublattice-parallel, and parallel. In order to compare the effects of the different update procedures on the properties of the stationary state, we use large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and analytical methods, especially the so-called matrix-product Ansatz ( M P A ) . We present in detail the exact solution for the model with sublatticeparallel and sequential updates using the MPA. For the case of parallel update, which is important for applications like traffic flow theory, we determine the phase diagram, the current, and density profiles based on Monte Carlo simulations. We furthermore suggest an MPA for that case and derive the corresponding matrix algebra.},

paper. Pedestrian facilities are classified based on their width as sidewalk, wide-sidewalk and precincts.
The analysis indicates that the pedestrian free flow speed is high on sidewalks (1.576 m/s) and low on
precincts (1.340 m/s). The increase in width of the facility resulted in increased space available to a
pedestrian, but reduced maximum flow rate and optimum density. It is found that the relationship between
speed and density follows Underwood (exponential) model on sidewalk of varying widths and
Greenshield’s (linear) model on a non-exclusive facility. Bi-directional flow on a facility affects the free
flow speed and space available to the pedestrian adversely at high density. Squeezing effect at the centre
and follow the predecessor near sides is observed under heavy bidirectional flow. The presence of a
bottleneck reduces the free flow speed and maximum flow substantially. Pedestrians moved in layers at
high density. Maximum flow rate is observed to be higher on the carriageway (2.067 ped/s) as compared
to an exclusive pedestrian facility (1.493 ped/s).},

  Abstract                 = {Crowds and other flock-like group motion are often modeled as interacting particle systems. These multi-agent simulations are computationally expensive because each agent must consider all of the others, if only to identify its neighbors. For large crowds, simple implementations are too slow since computation grows as the square of agent population. Faster approaches often rely on spatial hashing where a partitioning of space is used to accelerate crowd simulation. This same partitioning can form the basis of a scalable multi-processor approach to large, fast crowd simulations, as in [Quinn et al. 2003]. This paper describes an implementation of that approach for PLAYSTATIONÂ®3 which supports simulation and display of simple crowds of up to 15,000 individuals at 60 frames per second.},

The constrained patterns are captured by a leaderâ€“follower model and by a collision avoidance model. The spatial correlation between the alternatives is captured by a cross nested logit model. The model is estimated by maximum likelihood estimation on a real data set of pedestrian trajectories, manually tracked from video sequences.

  Abstract                 = {Rettungswege können in der heutigen Zeit mit verschiedenen Ingenieurmethoden geprüft und optimiert werden. Diese Methoden basieren auf zwei unterschiedlichen Ansätzen: dem makroskopischen und dem mikroskopischen Ansatz. Mit Hilfe beider Ansätze können Evakuierungszeiten für verschiedene Gebäude vorhergesagt werden. In dieser Arbeit werden verschiedene Grundrisstypen, bestehend aus Raum, Flur und Treppe, im Hinblick auf Evakuierungszeiten und Personenströme untersucht. Diese Untersuchung wird mit beiden Ansätzen durchgeführt. Für den makroskopischen Ansatz wird hierbei das Handrechenverfahren nach Predtetschenski und Milinski gewählt, der mikroskopische Ansatz wird durch aktuelle Computersimulationsprogramme (Aseri 3.4c, buildingEXODUS V 4.0 Level 2, PedGo 2.1.1 und Simulex 11.1.3) vertreten. Der Vergleich der Ergebnisse zeigt, dass selbst bei einfachsten Grundrissen unterschiedliche Evakuierungszeiten und Personenflüsse wiedergegeben werden.Weiterhin werden verschiedene Randbedingungen untersucht und deren Einfluss auf die Ergebnisse dargestellt.},

Contrary to open-source software tools users of these closed-source software-tools have to trust the technical manual of the software to understand how the software works. For users it is important to know how the model they use works, because without this knowledge results calculated by the software-tool can be interpreted in a wrong way, especially by doing risk analysis based on calculated results. We will present a methodology how to identify basics of evacuation modelling and how to interpret and understand calculated results in a better way. This methodology should give users a "better feeling" in a very short time for the model they use for evacuation analysis and calculation.},

These methods are based on two different principles: the macroscopic and the microscopic approach. Both allow forecasting of evacuation times for various settings. In the work presented simple settings are investigated, consisting of rooms, corridor and stairs with regard to evacuation times. These calculations use current computer simulation programs, based on microscopic models, and the macroscopic method of Predtechenskii and Milinskii [1]. For the computer simulation we used ASERI 3.4c, buildingEXODUS V4.0 Level 2, PedGo Version 2.1.1 and Simulex 11.1.3.

In this study, simulations for advanced evacuation analysis using a cell-based simulation model are performed. The cell-based simulation model divides the space in a uniform grid, “cell”. Each passenger in the ship is located in a cell and moves to another cell according to a set of local rules that are supposed to be associated with the individual, crowd, and counterflow-avoiding behavior of the passengers. These behavior patterns are implemented as the local rules and are assigned to each cell. Each cell was implemented using a combined discrete event and a discrete time simulation model that represents different variables of the local rules. To verify the applicability of the advanced ship evacuation analysis, it was applied to 11 tests specified in the IMO/MSC/Circ. 1238, and the result shows that all the requirements of such tests had been met. Finally, the analysis was applied to a car ferry having 2487 persons.},

  Abstract                 = {The current state-of-the-art presents a multiplicity of evacuation models for simulating emergency scenarios. Each model involves different methodological solutions to represent the same process and each one has its strengths and limitations. In addition, they have their own specific features and often practitioners do not have a thorough understanding of the variables that could be input into the models and how they will affect the results. Thus, there is a need to analyse the differences between the models, why they occur and how they affect the calculations. This study compares three evacuation models (FDS+Evac, STEPS, Pathfinder) and the analytical calculations provided in the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) Handbook, each of them using different simulation methods. The case-study is the Lantueno tunnel in Spain (a two-bore road tunnel with an emergency link tunnel between the two bores). The results initially show that, when considering evacuation scenarios with a single available exit and favourable response times, the obtained evacuation times do not differ significantly between the models. In a second step, the analysis of more complex scenarios has allowed the determination of the main factors of occupantâ€“fire interactions that cause the differences between the models: the use of unfavourable pre-evacuation times and the exit selection process under low visibility conditions. These differences occur in relation to: (1) modelling method, (2) degree of depth of the analysis of the fire conditions during the calibration of the inputs, and (3) userâ€™s experience in applying appropriate safety factors when using only one model. },

  Abstract                 = {To date, there is no International standard on the methods and tests to assess the verification and validation (V&V) of building fire evacuation models, i.e., model testers adopt inconsistent procedures or tests designed for other model uses. For instance, the tests presented within the MSC/Circ.1238 Guidelines for evacuation analysis for new and existing passenger ships provided by the International Maritime Organization are often employed for the V&V of models outside their original context of use (building fires instead of maritime applications). This document discusses the main issues associated with the definition of a standard procedure for the V&V of building fire evacuation models. A review of the current procedures, tests (e.g. the MSC/Circ.1238 Guidelines), and methods available in the literature to assess the V&V of building evacuation models is provided. The capabilities of building evacuation models are evaluated studying their five main core components, namely 1) Pre-evacuation time, 2) Movement and Navigation, 3) Exit usage, 4) Route availability and 5) Flow constraints. A set of tests and recommendations about the verification of building evacuation models is proposed. Suggestions on simple qualitative validation tests are provided together with examples of experimental data-sets suitable for the analysis of different core components. The uncertainties associated with evacuation modelling are discussed. In particular, a method for the analysis of behavioural uncertainty (uncertainty due to the use of distributions or stochastic variables to simulate human behaviour in evacuation modelling) is presented. The method consists of a set of convergence criteria based on functional analysis. The last part of this document presents a discussion on the definition of the acceptance criteria for a standard V&V protocol.},

The assumption is that the crisis area is observed by multiple cameras (fixed or mobile). The cameras sense the environment and extract features such as the amount of motion. These features are the input to a Bayesian network with nodes corresponding to situations such as terroristic attack, fire, and explosion. Given the probabilities of the observed features, by reasoning, the likelihood of the possible situations can be computed. A prototype was tested in a train compartment and its environment. Forty scenarios, performed by actors, were recorded. From the recordings the conditional probabilities have been computed. The scenarios are designed as scripts which proved to be a good methodology. The models, experiments and results will be presented in the paper.},

  Abstract                 = {In pedestrian evacuations bottlenecks can be a crucial factor influencing the evacuation time. The main question involves the design of bottlenecks to enable unhindered pedestrian flow in order to optimize evacuation times. For better understanding of this problem, a set of experiments with pedestrians in different bottleneck-scenarios has been performed. The results enlarge the database and allow the testing of the basic assumptions of performance based egress design. 
Within experimental series of evacuation trials the main focus is on two subjects of pedestrians flow dynamics: The fundamental diagram and bottleneck. In the following we present the bottleneck trials. The pedestrian experiments have been performed in well-controlled laboratory conditions. Special attention was given to the comparability of different experimental series because both variations of width and length of the bottleneck have an influence. Formation of lanes inside the bottleneck becomes less pronounced for wide bottlenecks, even for narrow bottlenecks the numbers of lanes don't interfere with the linear relations between flow and bottleneck width. Based on the length of the bottleneck the behavior of pedestrians is different, going through a tunnel or a door. Short bottlenecks show strong non-stationarity.},

  Abstract                 = {Escape way capacity calculation is an important item to realize safe buildings. In general, evacuation times are predicted by engineering methods with wide varieties in use and results. For example, Nelson defines capacity as a continuous and linear function to the escape way width. Hoogedoorn, however,describes a stepwise discontinuous increasing capacity.
To analyse the problem, a bottleneck experiment with students as test persons was arranged. The bottleneck width was varied in steps of 0.1 m starting with 0.8 m and ending with 1.2 m. The number of test persons was varied between 20, 40 and 60. Commerical DV-cameras recorded the procedure; the interpretation of films was accomplished manually, using a computer display.
The data shows a continuous change of time gaps, speed, density and finally personnel flow in the bottleneck. Furthermore transient phenomenon could be observed. Additionally, screening the video recordings a zipper effect is visible; this means, the persons optimize the density by themselves (see also 4).
In summary the experimentÂ´s most important result is the awareness of continuous rise in density, a step by step effect can not be observed- although this is a very popular consideration which can be found even in the German building regulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Several modeling approaches in both microscopic and macroscopic scales have been already put forward into the pedestrian modeling literature. The most operational one of these models is the social force model, where forces are ï¬�rst deï¬�ned by physical concepts (Newtonâ€™s equation) and then have been applied to pedestrian behaviors. On the contrary, there are also models based on discrete choice modeling concept that go deeper in behavioral aspects of pedestriansâ€™ reactions rather than physical forces. In this paper, ï¬�rst we go through the literature in pedestrian modeling domain. Subsequently a real pedestrian simulation experiment conducted in the SV building at EPFL (Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne) is explored. In this building, at a medium sized entrance hall peopleâ€™s walking behaviors become extremely interesting at certain periods of the day since they take different entrances and exits depending on various destinations that they can reach by passing this hall. We have put a strong emphasis on model calibration. The simulator we used for calibration and simulation is called VISSIM. The VISSWALK add-on of the software (intended exclusively for pedestrians) has been mainly exploited which is based on the social force model. Another dataset is currently collected at a train station which experiences interesting passenger behaviors. The train station is a highly frequent multi-modal transportation hub. This second dataset can be of a high interest for more development in pedestrian modeling especially in the model calibration and validation. Basically, the SV building project is a part of a bigger project concerning pedestrian ï¬‚ow simulation/optimization in a transportation hub where the same methodology and calibration method tested for the SV building are going to be exploited. For the SV building experiment various forecasting (demand change) and optimization (supply change) scenarios are also built and simulated. The analysis of the results from these scenarios is presented.},

However, these predictions have remained unverified because escape panic experiments with real systems are difficult to perform. For mice escaping out of a water pool, we found that for a critical sampling rate the escape behavior exhibits the predicted features even at short observation
times. The mice escaped via an exit in bursts of different sizes that obey exponential and (truncated) power-law distributions depending on exit width. Oversampling or undersampling the mouse escape rate prevents the observation of the predicted features. Real systems are normally subject to unavoidable constraints arising from occupancy rate, pedestrian exhaustion, and nonrigidity of pedestrian bodies. The effect of these constraints on the dynamics of real escape panic is also studied.},

In emergencies such as fire, the life of passengers is at high risk. But not only spatial restrictions of escape routes, also passenger characteristics are important. Subway passengers differ widely in their motivation and individual behavior. In this paper, we present a method offering a more elaborate approach for including characteristics, the Persona method. In this case the results of field studies, passenger counts, interviews and literature review led to the description of different Personas. },

In this part we discuss the basic concepts and theoretical techniques which are commonly used to study classical stochastic transport in systems of interacting driven particles. The analytical techniques include mean-field theories, matrix product ansatz, renormalization group, etc. and the numerical methods are mostly based on computer simulations. In the second part of the book these concepts and techniques are applied not only to vehicular traffic but also to transport and traffic-like phenomena in living systems ranging from collective movements of social insects (for example, ants) on trails to intracellular molecular motor transport. These demonstrate the conceptual unity of the fundamental principles underlying the apparent diversity of the systems and the utility of the theoretical toolbox of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in interdisciplinary research far beyond the traditional disciplinary boundaries of physics.},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-Agent Simulation is a general and powerful framework for understanding and predicting the behaviour of social systems. Here the authors investigate the behaviour of pedestrians and human crowds, especially their physical movement. Their aim is to build a bridge between the multi-agent and pedestrian dynamics communities that facilitates the validation and calibration of modelling approaches which is essential for any application in sensitive areas like safety analysis. Understanding the dynamical properties of large crowds is of obvious practical importance. Emergency situations require efficient evacuation strategies to avoid casualties and reduce the number of injured persons. In many cases legal requirements have to be fulfilled, for example, for aircraft or cruise ships. For tests already in the planning stage reliable simulation models are required to avoid additional costs for changes in the construction. First, the empirically observed phenomena are described, emphasizing the challenges they pose for any modelling approach and their relevance for the validation and calibration. Then the authors review the basic modelling approaches used for the simulation of pedestrian dynamics in normal and emergency situations, focussing on cellular automata models. Their achievements as well as their limitations are discussed in view of the empirical results. Finally, two applications to safety analysis are briefly described.},

We analyze in particular a one-dimensional, continuous in space model, for which we introduce some extensions. We investigate existence and uniqueness for local solutions of this extended model. In addition we present our numerical results. We investigate also the case that the number of pedestrians tends to infinity.
Furthermore we analyze for the continuous in space models under which conditions motionaround homogeneous flow is stable.
In addition we present a numerical simulation for a two dimensional social force model and give an outlook about the work which is still open.},

Observations of passenger movement in sport arenas and large underground railway stations as well as monitored evacuation drills are used to validate the computer program. The basic features of the ASERI computer program and the underlying assumptions with respect to human behaviour modelling are presented, followed by a discussion of case studies, including remarks on code validation, the reconstruction of actual hazards and examples of the use of ASERI to simulate the individual movement of passengers in complex environment. The importance of a careful choice of individual parameters describing the mobility of the occupants is demonstrated.},

The purpose of Hermes is the development of an evacuation assistant. Key outputs of the network model are travel (evacuation) times, identification of bottlenecks, pointing out alternative escape routes and/or optimization of escape route usage. The model uses Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE) to analyse the network. This way it is able to show pedestrian flow with transient congestion effects, leading to time-varying route choice during an evacuation. The results can be calculated before or during an emergency case. The calculation time is much shorter and the results can be shown quicker than with a common microsimulation movie or animation. But arguably a microsimulation can be more detailed and for absolute information like evacuation time more
conventional.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. Whenever a multiagent system is designed, many dep endencies in the system are identified and must be solved in a correct way. Coordination deals with the management of such dependencies. For that, two complementary viewpoints can be distinguished: subjective coordination manages intra-agent aspects while objective coordination essentially deals with inter-agent aspects. On the basis of this separation of concerns, the paper discusses the need of infrastructures for ob jective coordination. As in usual agent software platforms, this can be done by offering implicit support for ob jective coordination, by establishing the conditions necessary for running agent programs and maintaining agent interactions. Other infrastructures such as Electronic Institutions go one step further and shape the governing aspects of ob jective coordination. However, this is usually done through dedicated middle-agents that belong to the institution. An alternative approach is to transfer the governing or regulating responsibility from institutional agents to the environment of a multiagent system. A promising way of doing this is to view the environment as a rule-based infrastructure that defines reactions to events. This has the advantage of allowing for the definition of laws that not only regulate agent interaction (as most work in governed interaction), but any action within the environment. We illustrate this approach by several examples in different domains of laws.},

Especially major events like soccer games and concerts may lead to large crowds which need to be accommodated, while at the same time potential safety hazards like overcrowding must be avoided. The bottleneck capacities limit the capacities of the whole system and control the potential of high crowd densities on critical elements such as the platforms. We present an approach to estimate the maximum and effective capacity of key bottleneck elements based on controlled experiments and real world data sets of pedestrian movements for a subway station next to the main soccer stadium in Vienna. The focus is the fundamental diagram revealing both the maximal capacity as well as the effective capacity in terms of pedestrian flow rates. We present two controlled experiments and results based on real world data obtained during the European Soccer Championship (UEFA EURO 2008 (TM) ).},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The natural biomechanical motion process of many animals is stepwise. This feature of human movement and other bipeds is largely ignored in simulation models of pedestrians and crowds. We present a concise movement model for pedestrians based on stepwise movement. A series of controlled experiments was conducted to calibrate the model based on individual behaviour of pedestrians. We find that a change of direction is constrained by the current walking speed: the higher the speed the smaller the possible change of direction. Additionally, we present the trajectories and distances subjects held to a wall when walking around a corner. We use this result as a parameter for the simulation model. Finally, we validate the modelâ€™s behaviour with an egress scenario with a corridor as bottleneck. The resulting trajectories show behaviour that has been found in controlled experiments with similar set-ups: if there is enough space, individuals try to walk in the middle of the corridor, but when a congestion is present multiple lanes form allowing for higher pedestrian flow. The model separates the behavioural aspects from biomechanical movement thus facilitating expandability and allowing experts to focus on their respective fields of expertise. },

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the effects of auditory and visual distractions on pedestrian ambulation. A fundamental temporal characteristic of ambulation is the temporal fluctuation of the stride interval. In this paper, we investigate the stationarity of stride interval time series when people are exposed to different forms of auditory and visual distractions. An increase in nonstationary behavior may be suggestive of divided attention and more frequent central modulation of locomotion, both of which may have ramifications on pedestrian vigilance and responsiveness to environmental perturbations. One group of fifteen able-bodied (6 females) young adult participants completed a music protocol (overground walking with and without music). A second group of fifteen (7 females) did a television protocol (treadmill walking while watching \{TV\} with and without sound). Three walking trials, each 15&#xa0;min in duration, were performed at each participantâ€™s comfortable walking speed, with force sensitive resistors under the heel of each foot. Using the reverse arrangements test, the vast majority of time series were nonstationary, with a time-varying mean as the principal source of nonstationarity. Furthermore, the television trial with sound had the greatest number of nonstationarities followed by overground walking while listening to music. We discuss the possibility that these conditions measurably affect gait dynamics through a subconscious synchronization to external rhythms or a cyclic distraction followed by a period of increased conscious correction of gait timing. Our findings suggest that the regulation of stride timing is particularly susceptible to constant, time-evolving auditory stimuli, but that normal pacing can be restored quickly upon stimulus withdrawal. These kinds of sensory distractions should thus be carefully considered in studies of pedestrian ambulation. },

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, several approaches for modelling pedestrian dynamics have been proposed and applied e.g. for design of egress routes. However, so far not much attention has been paid to their quantitative validation. This unsatisfactory situation belongs amongst others on the uncertain and contradictory experimental data base. The fundamental diagram, i.e. the density-dependence of the flow or velocity, is probably the most important relation as it connects the basic parameter to describe the dynamic of crowds. But specifications in different handbooks as well as experimental measurements differ considerably. The same is true for the bottleneck flow. After a comprehensive review of the experimental data base we give an survey of a research project, including experiments with up to 250 persons performed under well controlled laboratory conditions. The trajectories of each person are measured in high precision to analyze the fundamental diagram and the flow through bottlenecks. The trajectories allow to study how the way of measurement influences the resulting relations. Surprisingly we found large deviation amongst the methods. These may be responsible for the deviation in the literature mentioned above. The results are of particular importance for the comparison of experimental data gained in different contexts and for the validation of models.},

  Abstract                 = {Capacity estimation is an important tool for the design and dimensioning of pedestrian facilities. The literature contains different procedures and specifications which show considerable differences with respect to the estimated flow values. Moreover do new experimental data indicate a stepwise growing of the capacity with the width and thus challenge the validity of the specific flow concept. To resolve these differences we have studied experimentally the unidirectional pedestrian flow through bottlenecks under laboratory conditions. The time development of quantities like individual velocities, density and individual time gaps in bottlenecks of different width is presented. The data show a linear growth of the flow with the width. The comparison of the results with experimental data of other authors indicates that the basic assumption of the capacity estimation for bottlenecks has to be revised. In contradiction with most planning guidelines our main result is, that a jam occurs even if the incoming flow does not overstep the capacity defined by the maximum of the flow according to the fundamental diagram.},

The fundamental diagram , i.e. the density - dependence of the flow or velocity, is probably the most important relation as it connects the basic parameter to describe the dynamic of crowds. But specifications in different handbooks as well as experimental measurements for the fundamental diagram differ considerably. We give a review of the experimental data base and the causes for the discrepancies discussed in the literature. Up to now it was neglected that the way of measurement can cause variations between the results of different studies. To shed some light on this problem we studied by means of experimental trajectories of the single file movement how different measurement methods influence the resulting fundamental diagram.},

The results for the fundamental diagram, i.e. the density-dependence of the flow or velocity, show that most existing multiagent models have to be modified even to reproduce the empirical findings qualitatively. Furthermore, the behaviour observed at bottlenecks indicates that the multi-agent nature of models is essential and that simple particle-like approaches are not sufficient for a realistic description.},

During the design and operation stages, modeling of the metro station evacuation capacity by using the computational models is an effective measure for guaranteeing the metro evacuation safety in the future. In this article, the safety strategy of evacuation in metro stations is first investigated and established, which involves the occupants needed to be evacuated, the evacuation route, and the safety zone. Then, an engineering calculation method for the metro station evacuation time is proposed. Based on the experimental data, simulation of evacuation process in different fire cases is conducted by using an agent-based model, so as to study the features of occupant evacuation behavior, the evacuation time, the passage flow rate, and the strategy of using the escalator as evacuation passage. These conclusions will be helpful for guiding the safe evacuation design of metros in China.},

By coupling with the fire scenario simulated by CFD technology, the computer simulation program may represent the overall and dynamic process of occupants' evacuation under fire expansion, and the mutual relationship between occupants' safety and fire hazard.

The four retail stores participating in the study were chosen to represent three-storey city centre stores and single-storey out-of-town stores in different locations in the United Kingdom. The evacuations were video taped using in-house closed-circuit television cameras (CCTY) orientated to cover pre-determined fields of view and additional portable cameras which were positioned and concealed when the stores were closed for business on the evenings before the evacuations. The evacuating customers were asked to complete a questionnaire by teams of researchers positioned outside, but not impeding, each emergency exit. Data sufficient for occupant characterisation and occupancy profiling for Marks and Spencer stores were obtained. Analysis of the video tapes a lso yielded information on total evacuation times and pre-movement times for each store. This research provided useful information, which informs the discussion in this paper of many issues relevant to the development of performance based codes, the profession and practice of fire safety engineering.

Previous documented crowd disasters have showed that collective movement patterns are affected by the layout or the geometrical structure of the escape area. However, little study has been carried out to examine these interactions under panic situation due to scarcity of data on human panic. Here, we use bio-inspired approach to test if making appropriate architectural adjustments within a given escape area would change the collective movement patterns in a way that enhances the outflow of the crowd. First, we performed a series of experiment with ants under panic conditions to test the effect of different structural features to the panic escape in a chamber with fixed dimension. Results show that the adjustments can be effective by more than 90% in decreasing the evacuation time. We then scaled it up and simulated the situation to human scenario and found that the model prediction is consistent with those observed from the empirical data. The proposed method demonstrates that detailed analysis of microscopic effects of escape environment would be a potentially valuable additional perspective to aid in devising solutions that are efficacious and improve the safety of the crowd. },

Collective patterns are not restricted to humans, but have been observed in other non-human biological systems. In this study, a mathematical model for crowd panic is derived from collective animal dynamics. The development and validation of the model is supported by data from experiments with panicking Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). A first attempt is also made to scale the model parameters for collective pedestrian traffic from those for ant traffic, by employing a scaling concept approach commonly used in biology.},

A literature review is used to examine how the study of mass movement of organisms might enhance the safety of pedestrians during emergency egress. Recent findings from experiments with panicking ants are then presented to illustrate, using two scenarios, how such experiments can potentially be used as a basis for the design of solutions for safe egress of pedestrians. Although the experiments are still in progress and it is too early to draw definitive conclusions with statistical significance, some preliminary results show promise in using ants to test models for pedestrian traffic in emergency conditions. Owing to the lack of complementary data during emergency/panic situations, experiments such as these with ants provide alternate empirical ways to test whether designs developed using mathematical models actually hold potential to be efficacious and improve the safety of pedestrians.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper argues that a comprehensive approach to crowd safety design, management and risk assessment needs to integrate psychology and engineering frames of reference. Psychology and engineering are characteristically mutually exclusive in their focus on the perspective of crowd rnembers who think and behat, e (psychology) or on static and dynamic objects (engineering).
Engineering places as much emphasis on the physical environment as psychology negates the relationship between the physical environment and people. This paper stresses the need to address the relationship between (A) design and engineeringÃ— (B) communications technology x ( C ) crowd managementx(D) crowd behaviour and movement. Theories of crowd psychology are briefly reviewed with particular reference to crowd ingress and egress and misconceptions about 'panic' or irrational behaviour. Assumptions about panic reinforce an emphasis on the control of a crowd, as if a crowd is a homogeneous mass of bodies or 'ballbearings', rather than the management of a crowd as a collection of individuals and social groups who need accurate and timely information if they are to remain sale. Particular emphasis is put on the fact that the time Ibr a crowd to escape from a sittlation of potential entrapment is a function of T ( Time to escape) = t~ ( time to start to move) + t2 ( time to move to and pass through exits), rather than T= t2. This is illustrated by reference to research of escape behaviour in the Summerland fire and underground station evacuations. The paper concludes by stressi.ng the need to validate computer simulations of crowd movement and escape behaviour against psychological as well as engineering criteria.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Pedestrians adjust both speed and stride length when they navigate difficult situations such as tight corners or dense crowds. They try to avoid collisions and to preserve their personal space. State-of-the-art pedestrian motion models automatically reduce speed in dense crowds simply because there is no space where the pedestrians could go. The stride length and its correct adaptation, however, are rarely considered. This leads to artefacts that impact macroscopic observation parameters such as densities in front of bottlenecks and, through this, flow. Hence modelling stride adaptation is important to increase the predictive power of pedestrian models. To achieve this we reformulate the problem as an optimisation problem on a disk around the pedestrian. Each pedestrian seeks the position that is most attractive in a sense of balanced goals between the search for targets, the need for individual space and the need to keep a distance from obstacles. The need for space is modelled according to findings from psychology defining zones around a person that, when invaded, cause unease. The result is a fully automatic adjustment that allows calibration through meaningful social parameters and that gives visually natural results with an excellent fit to measured experimental data. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method for automatically detecting unusual human events on stairs from video data. The motivation is to provide a tool for biomedical researchers to rapidly find the events of interest within large quantities of video data. Our system identifies potential sequences containing anomalies, and reduces the amount of data that needs to be searched by a human. We compute two sets of features from a video of a person descending a stairwell. The first set of features are the foot positions and velocities. We track both feet using a mixed state particle filter with an appearance model based on histograms of oriented gradients. We compute expected (most likely) foot positions given the state of the filter at each frame. The second set of features are the parameters of the mean optical flow over a foreground region. Our final classification system inputs these two sets of features into a hidden Markov model (HMM) to analyse the spatio-temporal progression of the stair descent. A single HMM is trained on sequences of normal stair use, and a threshold on sequence likelihoods is used to detect unusual events in new data. We demonstrate our system on a data set with five people descending a set of stairs in a laboratory environment. We show how our system can successfully detect nearly all anomalous events, with a low false positive rate. We discuss limitations and suggest improvements to the system.},

The strategy is shown to be optimal in two senses: (i) it evacuates the maximum number of people at all times, and (ii) it finishes the evacuation in the least possible time. In both cases, it favors the people most at risk. The results shed light on other traffic problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract There are few studies investigating crowd dynamics in panic situations. They used measures such as exit flow rate to explore the exit performance in evacuation scenarios. However, there is limited research exploring the relationship of exit flow rate and density behind the exit for panic scenarios. This study presents a macro level analysis to investigate the relationship of exit flow and exit jam characteristics. Animal group behavior (i.e. panicked woodlice experiments) is utilized for data analysis. The results reveal that change in woodlice escaping behavior cause an increasing trend in exit capacity as the jam behind the exit increases. },

  Abstract                 = {Individual-oriented simulation allows us to represent the global behavior of a system through local interaction in discrete time steps. As we face up close-to-reality models and large-scale workloads, we focus on turning from traditional approaches towards distributed simulation in order to obtain more accurate results in less time. One of the main problems in distributed simulation is how to distribute individuals efficiently through distributed architecture. Individual-oriented systems can be implemented in a distributed fashion by using either a grid-based or cluster-based approach. On one hand, grid-based approaches consist of assigning to each node a simulation space portion, together with the set of individuals currently residing in that area. On the other hand, cluster-based approaches consist of assigning to each node a fixed set of individuals. In this work we present a cluster-based method based on Voronoi diagrams and covering radius criterion in order to avoid unnecessary interaction between individuals. We can show experimentally that our proposal reduces the communication and computing times significantly increasing simulation efficiency. },

In the new model, finer lattice is used; thus each pedestrian occupies multiple grids instead of one, and the rules of interactions among pedestrians or pedestrians and constructions are built. The interaction forces including extrusion, repulsion and friction are considered as passive factors for evacuation. The strength of the drift, or the intensity of the pedestrians to move toward the exit rapidly, is considered an active factor. A simple situation is studied in which pedestrians try to evacuate from a large room with only one door. The influences of interaction forces and drift on evacuation time are analyzed. The mutual restriction relation of the two factors in the course of evacuating is found.},

However, many existing evacuation models are either computationally inefficient, or are missing some crucial human behaviors in crowds. In this paper, we improve a cellular automata (CA) model introduced recently, which quantifies evacuation process with three basic forces, and compare its performance with the social force model introduced by Helbing et al. in an 200-people evacuation of a single-exit square room. The main characteristics compared include arching, clogging and faster-is-slower behaviors, as well as the evacuation time. The results show that the two models are comparable in all calculations, indicating that the three forces, i.e., repulsion, friction and attraction, are basic reasons for complex behaviors emerged from evacuation. Furthermore, because of its simple rules and fast calculation speed, the discussed CA model is easily analyzed and is very helpful to the applications.},

Crowd disasters at mass gathering events have not been fully researched and this review examines these aiming to provide future suggestions for event organisers, medical resource planners, and emergency services, including local hospital emergency departments.

Methods: A review was conducted using computerised data bases: MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, HMIC and EMBASE, with Google used to widen the search beyond peer-reviewed publications, to identify grey literature. All peer-review literature articles found containing information pertaining to lessons identified from mass gathering crowd disasters were analysed and reviewed. Disasters occurring in extreme weather events, and environmental leading to participant illness were not included. These articles were read, analysed, abstracted and summarised.

Results: 156 articles from literature search were found detailing mass gathering disasters identified from 1971 – 2011. With only 21 cases found within peer-review literature. Twelve events were further documented as a case reports. Five events were examined as review articles while four events underwent commissioned inquiries. Analysis of cases were categorised in to crowd control, event access, fire safety, medical preparedness and emergency response.

Conclusions: Mass gathering events have an enormous potential to place a severe strain on the local health care system, and a mixture of high crowd density, restricted points of access, poor fire safety, minimum crowd control and lack of on-site medical care can lead to problems that end in disaster.},

This paper examines how distributions of pre-evacuation times affect the occupant travel time and hence their effect on the evacuation time in the Simulex model. A simple scenario is assessed mathematically and compared with the results from Simulex with further simulations carried out on a somewhat more complex scenario. Because we expect the pre-evacuation time to be characterized by a distribution of values, simply adding the maximum pre-evacuation time and the movement time over-estimates the evacuation time. Furthermore, when the preevacuation distribution is small the travelling and queuing effects dominate the simulated evacuation time. When the pre-evacuation distribution is large, then travel and queuing effects are not so important and it is the pre-evacuation time that dominates. Finally, the paper examines some aspects of the Simulex model in situations where there is a high occupant density in a space.},

Tank, self-organizing maps, i.e., Kohonen networks, coupled selec-

analytically and the costs of the solutions are compared numerically
with those of solutions obtained by simulated annealing and the costs
of a global optimal solution.
Using dynamical systems, a solution to the combinatorial optimization
problem emerges in the limit of large times as an asymptotically stable
point of the dynamics. The obtained solutions are often not globally
optimal but good approximations of it. Dynamical system as well as
neural network approaches are appropriate methods for distributed and
parallel processing. Because of the parallelization, these techniques are
able to compute a given task much faster than algorithms which are
using a traditional sequentially working digital computer.
The article focuses on dynamical system approaches to the linear two-
index assignment problem and the N P-hard three-index assignment
problem. These and extensions thereof can be used as models for many
industrial problems like manufacturing planning and optimization of
flexible manufacturing systems. This is illustrated for an example in
distributed robotic systems.},

which occurs for instance as an important task in flexible manufac-
turing environments, is solved by using a self-organization approach
motivated by pattern formation principles in biological, chemical,
and physical systems. Similar to observations in many natural sys-
tems, such as ant tribes, the pattern formation of colored shells or
convection patterns in the Rayleigh–Bénard problem of fluid dy-
namics, the self-organization principles lead to a robust and fault
tolerant behavior where the patterns or structures recover from dis-
turbances. The considered problem is the dynamic assignment of a
number of robots to given targets where the mobile robots have to
move to the targets in order to perform some tasks there. Hereby,
each robot uses only local information (i.e., no world coordinate
system is necessary). The underlying mathematical problem of the
robot–target assignment is the so-called two-index assignment prob-
lem from combinatorial optimization. The approach used guarantees
always feasible solutions in the assignment of robotic units to tar-
gets. As a consequence, for scenarios with only convex obstacles
with large enough distances to each other, no spurious states cause
the assignment process to fail. The error resistant control method
for distributed autonomous robotic systems is demonstrated by sev-
eral experiments with mobile robots. These results are compared and

  Abstract                 = {The motion of pedestrian crowds (e.g. for simulation of an evacuation situation) can be modeled as a multi-body system of self driven particles with repulsive interaction [4, 5, 6, 9]. We use a few simple situations to determine the simplest allowed functional form of the force function. More complexity may be necessary to model more complex situations. There are many unknown parameters to such models, which have to be adjusted correctly to give proper predictions of evacuation times, local densities and forces on rails or obstacles.
The parameters of the social force model [4, 5, 6] can be related to quantities that can be measured independently, like step length and frequency. The microscopic behavior is, however, only poorly reproduced in many situations, a person approaching a standing or slow obstacle will e.g. show oscillations in position [9], and the trajectories of two persons meeting in a corridor in opposite direction will be far from realistic and somewhat erratic.
One of the reasons why these models are not realistic is the assumption of instantaneous reaction on the momentary situation. Obviously, persons react with a small time lag [7], while on the other hand they will anticipate changing situations for at least a short time. Thus basing the repulsive interaction not on the momentary situation but on a (linear) extrapolation over a short time (e.g. 1 s) eliminates the oscillations at slowing down and smoothes the patterns of giving way to others to a more realistic behavior. The exact extrapolation time is of little importance, but a combination of long time with linear extrapolation may get unstable. One second anticipation seems reasonable, and while the actual anticipation in peoples mind will most likely not be based on linear extrapolation, the differences will be small. A second reason is the additive combination of binary interactions. It is shown that combining only a few relevant interactions gives better model performance.},

However, experiments that have been done either gave only collective data like averages of flux and density, or treated only very simple situations like two person interactions. The progress of digital cameras and of image processing during recent years now allows the meas-urement of pedestrian movements on a ``microscopic'' scale with low costs. Com-paring forces derived from measured trajectories with calculated ones for the same situation allows a microscopic analysis of models and shows what parameters are important in special situations. Applying these methods to bottleneck experiments shows the importance of removing the effects of head movement and of stepping from the trajectories before calculating forces.},

  Abstract                 = {For the planning of large pedestrian facilities, the movement of pedestrians in various situations has to be modelled. Many tools for pedestrian planning are based on cellular automata (CA), discrete in space and time, some use self driven particles (SDP), continuous in space and time. It is common experience that CA have problems with modelling sharp bends in wide corridors. They tend to move the pedestrians to the innermost lanes far too strongly, thereby reducing the capacity of the facility. With SDP, the problem seems to be less pronounced but still present. With CA, we compare the performance of two standard shortest distance based static floors on 90o and 180o bends with a newly defined one. For SDP, we demonstrate how variations in the modelling of the momentary destination of the agents influence trajectories and capacity.},

However, density and flow are concepts of fluid mechanics defined for the limit of infinitely many particles. Standard methods of measuring these quantities locally (e.g. counting heads within a rectangle) suffer from large data scatter. The remedy of averaging over large spaces or long times reduces the possible resolution and inhibits the gain obtained by the new technologies.
In this contribution we introduce a concept for measuring microscopic characteristics on the basis of pedestrian trajectories. Assigning a personal space to every pedestrian via a Voronoi diagram reduces the density scatter. Similarly, calculating direction and speed from position differences between times with identical phases of movement gives low-scatter sequences for speed and direction. Closing we discuss the methods to obtain reliable values for derived quantities and new possibilities of in depth analysis of experiments. The resolution obtained indicates the limits of stationary state theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedestrian movements can be modeled at different degrees of detail. While flux models (Predeshensky/Milinski 1971) and cellular automata models (Schreckenberg 2002) give answers to some important questions and are fast and easy to use, continuous space modeling has the potential of full flexibility in geometry and realistic description of individual movements in arbitrary fine resolution. While the acceleration forces in these models are known with good reliability, there is no agreement on the repulsive forces, not even on the functional form of these forces (Lakoba 2005, Molnar 1996, Parisi 2005, Yu 2005). We give some basic consideration to define the minimal complexity of the functional form of the repulsive forces together with some estimates of the values of parameters. From these considerations it becomes obvious that the repulsive forces have to depend not only on the relative position of persons, but also on the speeds and speed differences. The parameters of these forces will be situation dependant. They can in principle be derived from video observations of people moving, although the large scatter of data and the complexity involved makes for large uncertainties.},

  Abstract                 = {With the expected growth of public transport volumes within the next years, the simulation of
pedestrian flows to design new and assess existing pedestrian walking facilities becomes of in-
creasing importance. To get meaningful simulation results, accurate pedestrian flow models are
required. These models include the appropriate description of the pedestrian behaviour in nor-
mal as well as safety-critical conditions (e.g., evacuations). Furthermore, planners and engineers
require tools, which allow for fast and reliable simulations of real-world problems. In this paper,
we present some results from investigations performed with the commercial pedestrian simula-
tion tool SimWalk. The tool is based upon the (microscopic) Social Force Model (SFM), devel-
oped by Helbing and co-workers that describes the walking behaviour of pedestrians. To reduce
the computational complexity, the actual implementation is a reduced version of the SFM. Thus
one goal of this paper was to investigate the impact of the model simplifications on the simula-
tion results, i.e. to test, how realistic the pedestrian behaviour is. This was done by assessing the
model behaviour at the macroscopic as well as at the microscopic level. For the two parameters
that determine the pedestrian interactions, we tried to find optimal values such that a combined
assessment measure (macro and micro) was minimised. With this task, we also gained some in-
sight into the sensitivity of the simulation output on the model parameters.
The results show that even with the reduced SFM, the model shows realistic behaviour for the
investigated scenarios, both on the macroscopic and on the microscopic level. Furthermore, the
estimated values of the model parameters are well within the range suggested by references
(based on empirical investigations or estimates).
For the further development of the model/the tool we suggest: Additional tests and compari-
sons: (i) Refinement of the tests performed herein, i.e. more simulation runs on a denser pa-
rameter grid, (ii) Comparison with trajectories from empirical investigations (at macro and mi-
cro level), (iii) Investigations on self-organised behaviour as found for example in two-
directional flows (lane formation) and at crossing flows (stripe formation); Model extensions:
(iv) Set the model parameters individually per pedestrian, whenever possible, (v) Investigation
of possible model extensions, towards the original version of the SFM (includes relaxation time
and anisotropy) and/or beyond (e.g., include a finite reaction time of the pedestrians); and (vi)
Integration of tactical behaviour (e.g., route choice).},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Understanding how levels of satisfaction differ across transportation modes can be helpful to encourage the use of active as well as public modes of transportation over the use of the automobile. This study uses a large-scale travel survey to compare commuter satisfaction across six modes of transportation (walking, bicycle, automobile, bus, metro, commuter train) and investigates how the determinants of commuter satisfaction differ across modes. The framework guiding this research assumes that external and internal factors influence satisfaction: personal, social, and attitudinal variables must be considered in addition to objective trip characteristics. Using ordinary least square regression technique, we develop six mode-specific models of trip satisfaction that include the same independent variables (trip and travel characteristics, personal characteristics, and travel and mode preferences). We find that pedestrians, train commuters and cyclists are significantly more satisfied than drivers, metro and bus users. We also establish that determinants of satisfaction vary considerably by mode, with modes that are more affected by external factors generally displaying lower levels of satisfaction. Mode preference (need/desire to use other modes) affects satisfaction, particularly for transit users. Perceptions that the commute has value other than arriving at a destination significantly increases satisfaction for all modes. Findings from this study provide a better understanding of determinants of trip satisfaction to transport professionals who are interested in this topic and working on increasing satisfaction among different mode users. },

  Abstract                 = {This report presents two new models to simulate the behavior of pedestrians. The first model uses a potential field model approach invented by Hoogendoorn and Bovy, but calculates the field using a wave algorithm instead of partial differential equations. The second model uses significant points in the environment to generate first a visibility graph and then a minimal spanning tree using the algorithm from Dijkstra. The walking direction and speed of the pedestrians depends on three forces similar to the social force model by Helbing. The first force leads the agent toward its destination by using either the potential field or the calculated spanning tree. A second force regulates the interactions between agents, so ensuring that agents do not walk into other pedestrians and try to keep a certain distance from each other. The third force guarantees that agents do not walk into walls and that they try to keep a certain distance from walls. The behavior of pedestrians simulated with the two models is quite similar, the main difference lies in the models' performance. The spanning tree approach is slower than the potential field model when simple simulations are used, as it spends most time on the creation of the visibility graph. The advantages of the spanning tree model are found when more sophisticated simulations with different destinations are run, as all spanning trees can be based on the same visibility graph, where else a new potential field needs to be calculated for each destination.

The correctness of the models is proved by comparing the average pedestrian speed in a corridor with increased pedestrian density and fraction to empirical results collected byWeidmann. The models are kept rather simple to ensure fast and efficient simulations. Some large simulations of Zurich main station (700 x 200m) are used to show the useability of both models for simulations of large pedestrian infrastructures. It further presents some new aspects for pedestrian simulations: a walkability graph adapting the agents' speed on special terrain (stairs, escalators), simulations in buildings with several floors, multiple destinations (allowing to use activities like "walk to the next exit") and rated destinations (allowing activities like "buy a new ticket, accept 10m of extra walking if it can be bought at a ticket desk rather than an automata").},

  Abstract                 = {A traffic jam on a highway is a very familiar phenomenon. From the
physical viewpoint, the system of vehicular flow is a non-equilibrium system
of interacting particles (vehicles). The collective effect of the many-particle
system induces the instability of a free flow state caused by the enhancement
of fluctuations, and the transition to a jamming state occurs spontaneously if
the average vehicle density exceeds a certain critical value. Thus, a bottleneck
is only a trigger and not the essential origin of a traffic jam. In this paper, we
present the first experimental evidence that the emergence of a traffic jam is a
collective phenomenon like ‘dynamical’ phase transitions and pattern formation
in a non-equilibrium system. We have performed an experiment on a circuit to
show the emergence of a jam with no bottleneck. In the initial condition, all the
vehicles are moving, homogeneously distributed on the circular road, with the
same velocity. The average density of the vehicles is prepared for the onset of
the instability. Even a tiny fluctuation grows larger and then the homogeneous
movement cannot be maintained. Finally, a jam cluster appears and propagates
backward like a solitary wave with the same speed as that of a jam cluster on a
highway.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

  Abstract                 = {Moving animal groups provide some of the most intriguing and difficult to characterise examples of collective behaviour. We review some recent (and not so recent) empirical research on the motion of animal groups, including fish, locusts and homing pigeons. An important concept which unifies our understanding of these groups is that of transfer of directional information. Individuals which change their direction of travel in response to the direction taken by their near neighbours can quickly transfer information about the presence of a predatory threat or food source. We show that such information transfer is optimised when the density of individuals in a group is close to that at which a phase transition occurs
between random and ordered motion. Similarly, we show that even relatively small differences in information possessed by group members can lead to strong collectivelevel decisions for one of two options. By combining the use of self-propelled particle and social force models of collective motion with thinking about the evolution of flocking we aim to better understand how complexity arises within these groups.},

First, the computational model of ACCEM is introduced. Next, the vision-based recognition algorithm and the reverse reasoning in ACCEM are explained in detail. Last, a demonstration of ACCEM successfully deducing the subject's choices along an observed trajectory is illustrated.

  Abstract                 = {The emergence of a traffic jam is considered to be a dynamical phase transition in a physics point of view; traffic flow becomes unstable and changes phase into a traffic jam when the car density exceeds a critical value. In order to verify this view, we have been performing a series of circuit experiments. In our previous work (2008 New J. Phys. 10 033001), we demonstrated that a traffic jam emerges even in the absence of bottlenecks at a certain high density. In this study, we performed a larger indoor circuit experiment in the Nagoya Dome in which the positions of cars were observed using a high-resolution laser scanner. Over a series of sessions at various values of density, we found that jammed flow occurred at high densities, whereas free flow was conserved at low densities. We also found indications of metastability at an intermediate density. The critical density is estimated by analyzing the fluctuations in speed and the densityâ€“flow relation. The value of this critical density is consistent with that observed on real expressways. This experiment provides strong support for physical interpretations of the emergence of traffic jams as a dynamical phase transition.},

It is shown that the dynamical phase transitions depend on both inlet densities. The four distinct phases are found. The phase diagram is presented for the distinct phases. The scaling of saturated flow rate and transition point is shown. The flow rate exhibits the universal scaling form.},

Walkers form in line and the two types of walkers file alternately. With increasing density, the filing appears distinctly. When the density is higher than the critical value, all walkers are hard to go ahead and the jamming transition occurs.

The escape time of a person depends highly on the position where the person exists initially within the hall. The dependences of the mean value and variance of escape time on the position are calculated. It is shown that the mean escape time exhibits a highest value at the front edges. The variance of escape time has a highest value at both positions just next door to the exit. The dependence of escape time on the exit width is also shown. It is found that the escape time exhibits a wide distribution depending on the initial position of people and the exit width.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the objectives of the pedestrian studies is to evaluate the effects of a proposed policy on the pedestrian facilities before its implementation. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy regarding the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation. The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight regarding the possible application of the microscopic pedestrian model. The microscopic pedestrian model was developed and the microscopic pedestrian data validated it. Although the model is very simple, it shows the lane formation, self-organization phenomena as seen in the real world. Three microscopic simulation scenarios were developed. The first scenario compares one-way and two-way pedestrian traffic to gain more understanding about their characteristics. The second scenario is to know the behavior of the system if the number of elderly pedestrian increases. The third scenario proposes a policy of lane-like segregation towards pedestrian crossing and inspects the performance of the crossing.},

  Abstract                 = {A standard evacuation map posted in a room shows the location of the current room and the path to the nearest exit. If the number of occupants in the building is only small, then the shortest paths to the exits may enable all the occupants to evacuate in minimum possible time. Previous studies have shown, however, that the shortest path configuration does not lead to minimum egress time for large crowds in public facilities such as those in a school, theater or gym.
We extend the previous studies by determining the minimum egress time for different crowd sizes on a fixed network graph. We apply optimization search on a mesoscopic multi-agent pedestrian simulation that employs the concept of Route-Choice Self-Organization (RCSO). We show that the egress time gap between the shortest path configuration and RCSO configuration increases very quickly with respect to crowd size. Thus, for crowded pedestrian facilities, there may be a need to revise the standard evacuation map so that evacuation behavior that approximates the RCSO becomes possible, and this can lead to a much better egress time.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a pedestrian movement model, which use a multi agents system for pedestrian traffic analysis. The model captures the dynamic microscopic interaction between pedestrians, which cannot be addressed using traditional macroscopic approach. The pedestrians are modeled as autonomous agents with non-linear system differential equations. The pedestrian agents may avoid other pedestrians, passing and overtaking slower pedestrians and to form a self-organization behavior of lane formations as in real pedestrian studies. A critical issue for such multi-agent pedestrian models, however, is the validation of the model against real world data. We show that the sensitivity analysis of control variables and parameters of the multi-agents model form the basis in ensuring the validation step. The model was automatically validated using real world data by minimizing the difference between the speed distributions. With the validated model, we can utilize model applications to evaluate pedestrian facilities.},

  Abstract                 = {Current evacuation models have been found to have limitations either in the scope of their simulation, or the size of the scenario that can be simulated. A model currently under development called EvacuatioNZ was produced to address some of these limitations. EvacuatioNZ is a coarse network model that simulates the occupant movement times as well as the human behaviour before and during the evacuation process. It incorporates the Monte Carlo approach in producing probability distributions of evacuation times. This model is designed to allow the expansion or modification of the program as more knowledge on human behaviour and occupant emergency movement is obtained, without the need to reproduce the entire model.
The main aim of this research was to assist in the development of this evacuation model by carrying out validation processes that tested the model's components. This would allow the model to be used with reasonable confidence by designers and fire engineers.
Individual component testing on the model has shown that the basic components of movement are working satisfactorily, and are producing results that are comparable to values produced by the Nelson and MacLennan flow equations. Tests using a combination of components have also been found to produce representative results, when similar assumptions are being used. However, more components, including the behavioural components, should be tested before this model can be used for design purposes.
The current version of the program still has some limitations that need to be addressed in order to increase its functional value. Further research should also include the model validation using more calculation examples, as well as data from actual trial evacuations to validate the components of human behaviour in the model.},

Walking speeds, flow rates and movement parameters are compared to real-life data, and the success of applying the package to real-life data, and the success of applying the package to real-life problems is discussed.

  Abstract                 = {A number of computer models for the evacuation of buildings have been produced in recent years. These models typically use a system known as 'network-node' modelling, which makes a number of large assumptions concerning human motion. Methods used in the software package 'SIMULEX' differ from the traditional methods of assessing motion in terms of average parameters and 'flow rates'. The most significant feature of the model is the geometrically accurate simulation of the evacuation movement of each individual person from a building space. The algorithms which achieve this movement are not based on any standard method of evacuation modelling, so it is important to assess how realistic the algorithms prove to be, and also to investigate the performance of the system as a whole.
This paper describes a series of tests in which SIMULEX models the movement of a large group of people through a number of exits of different widths. The maximum sustainable flow rates that were achieved in the tests are presented and compared to data from different sources. The application of SIMULEX to the proposed design of a large commercial store is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Evacuation experiments of pedestrians passing through a corridor, which acts as a bottleneck, are conducted in this study. A video processing method is used to extract the trajectories of pedestrians in the measurement section. The velocity, density, flow rate and time headway between successive pedestrians entering the bottleneck are calculated, and the relations between them are obtained from the trajectories. We report that the mean velocities for each experiment vary greatly, depending on the lanes contained in the measurement section. The mean velocity of each pedestrian in the corridor displays a trend that decreases sharply at the beginning and then fluctuates slightly around the mean value. A fundamental diagram relating density and speed is obtained. We also investigate the relation between the mean velocities of pedestrians and the density, as a function of time, and report that the mean velocity decreased while the density increased. These results are consistent with those of other researchers. The flow rate increases linearly with the bottleneck width, which is consistent with other results. The time headways are investigated in this study. It is observed that the behavior of pedestrians in the corridor, such as when they formed lanes, has a significant effect on the time headways and their distribution. The distribution of time headways in different lanes is also studied, and some interesting results are obtained. The data and results provided in this paper may be useful for improving evacuation models and designing public facilities.},

Using numerical simulations of a recent stochastic car-following model we show that this strategy yields optimization of traffic flow when implemented in systems with a localized periodic inhomogeneity, such as signalized intersections and entry ramps. The optimization process is explained by our finding of a generalized fundamental diagram (GFD) for traffic, namely a flux-density-wavelength relation. Projecting the GFD on the density-flux plane yields a two-dimensional region of stable states, qualitatively similar to that found empirically [Kerner, Phys. Rev.

  Abstract                 = { The paper presents the main aspects of a stochastic conservative model of the evolution of the number of vehicles per road section. The model, defined in continuous time on a discrete space, follows a misanthrope Markovian process. It is a mesoscopic traffic model in the following sense: the vehicles are individually considered, but their dynamics are aggregated per section. The model parameters are supply and demand functions in equilibrium (i.e. a fundamental diagram). In order to model flows on a traffic network, different schemes of junction dynamics are proposed. The model properties in transient and stationary states are investigated analytically in simple cases and by simulation. The results show that the process presents classical properties of deterministic macroscopic model such as the propagation of shock or rarefaction wave for Riemann initial condition. On the other hand, one observes phenomena usually related to high order models, such as a wide scattering of the flow performances or the propagation (backward or forward according to the density level) of local perturbations, due to the stochasticity. },

  Abstract                 = {This contribution presents a derivation of the steady-state distribution of velocities and distances of driven particles on a onedimensional periodic ring. We will compare two different situations: (i) symmetrical interaction forces fulfilling Newton's law of "actio = reactio" and (ii) asymmetric, forwardly directed interactions as, for example in vehicular traffic. Surprisingly, the steady-state velocity and distance distributions for asymmetric interactions and driving terms agree with the equilibrium distributions of classical many-particle systems with symmetrical interactions, if the system is large enough. This analytical result is confirmed by computer simulations and establishes the possibility of approximating the steady state statistics in driven many-particle systems by Hamiltonian systems. Our finding is also useful to understand the various departure time distributions of queueing systems as a possible effect of interactions among the elements in the respective queue [D. Helbing et al., Physica A 363, 62 (2006)].},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract When simulating trajectories by integrating time-continuous car-following models, standard integration schemes such as the fourth-order Rungeâ€“Kutta method (RK4) are rarely used while the simple Euler method is popular among researchers. We compare four explicit methods both analytically and numerically: Eulerâ€™s method, ballistic update, Heunâ€™s method (trapezoidal rule), and the standard RK4. As performance metrics, we plot the global discretization error as a function of the numerical complexity. We tested the methods on several time-continuous car-following models in several multi-vehicle simulation scenarios with and without discontinuities such as stops or a discontinuous behavior of an external leader. We find that the theoretical advantage of \{RK4\} (consistency orderÂ 4) only plays a role if both the acceleration function of the model and the trajectory of the leader are sufficiently often differentiable. Otherwise, we obtain lower (and often fractional) consistency orders. Although, to our knowledge, Heunâ€™s method has never been used for integrating car-following models, it turns out to be the best scheme for many practical situations. The ballistic update always prevails over Eulerâ€™s method although both are of first order. },

  Abstract                 = {Despite the availability of large empirical data sets and the long history of traffic modeling, the theory of traffic congestion on freeways is still highly controversial. In this contribution, we compare Kerner's three-phase traffic theory with the phase diagram approach for traffic models with a fundamental diagram. We discuss the inconsistent use of the term "traffic phase" and show that patterns demanded by three-phase traffic theory can be reproduced with simple two-phase models, if the model parameters are suitably specified and factors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered, such as effects of noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design (e.g. combinations of off- and on-ramps). Conversely, we demonstrate that models created to reproduce three-phase traffic theory create similar spatiotemporal traffic states and associated phase diagrams, no matter whether the parameters imply a fundamental diagram in equilibrium or non-unique flow-density relationships. In conclusion, there are different ways of reproducing the empirical stylized facts of
spatiotemporal congestion patterns summarized in this contribution, and it appears possible to overcome the controversy by a more precise definition of the scientific terms and a more careful comparison of models and data, considering effects of the measurement process and the right level of detail in the traffic model used.},

  Abstract                 = {We present data from several German freeways showing different kinds of congested traffic forming near road inhomogeneities, specifically lane closings, intersections, or uphill gradients. The states are localized or extended, homogeneous or oscillating. Combined states are observed as well, like the coexistence of moving localized clusters and clusters pinned at road inhomogeneities, or regions of oscillating congested traffic upstream of nearly homogeneous congested traffic. The experimental findings are consistent with a recently proposed theoretical phase diagram for traffic near on-ramps [D. Helbing, A. Hennecke, and M. Treiber, Phys.Rev. Lett. 82, 4360 (1999)]. We simulate these situations with a continuous microscopic single-lane model, the "intelligent driver model," using empirical boundary conditions. All observations, including the coexistence of states, are qualitatively reproduced by describing inhomogeneities with local variations of one model parameter. We show that the results of the microscopic model can be understood by formulating the theoretical phase diagram for bottlenecks in a more general way. In particular, a local drop of the road capacity induced by parameter variations has essentially the same effect as an on-ramp.},

The human visual system is highly sensitive to biological motion and capable of extracting socially relevant information from it. Here we investigate the question of how such information is encoded in biological motion patterns and how such information can be retrieved. A framework is developed that transforms biological motion into a representation allowing for analysis using linear methods from statistics and pattern recognition. Using gender classification as an example, simple classifiers are constructed and compared to psychophysical data from human observers. The analysis reveals that the dynamic part of the motion contains more information about gender than motion-mediated structural cues. The proposed framework can be used not only for analysis of biological motion but also to synthesize new motion patterns. A simple motion modeler is presented that can be used to visualize and exaggerate the differences in male and female walking patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Gibson's ecological theory of perception has received considerable attention within psychology literature, as well as in computer vision and robotics. However, few have applied Gibson's approach to agent-based models of human movement, because the ecological theory requires that individuals have a vision-based mental model of the world, and for large numbers of agents this becomes extremely expensive computationally. Thus, within current pedestrian models, path evaluation is based on calibration from observed data or on sophisticated but deterministic route-choice mechanisms; there is little open-ended behavioural modelling of human-movement patterns. One solution which allows individuals rapid concurrent access to the visual information within an environment is an 'exosomatic visual architecture', where the connections between mutually visible locations within a configuration are prestored in a lookup table. Here we demonstrate that, with the aid of an exosomatic visual architecture, it is possible to develop behavioural models in which movement rules originating from Gibson's principle of affordance are utilised. We apply large numbers of agents programmed with these rules to a built-environment example and show that, by varying parameters such as destination selection, field of view, and steps taken between decision points, it is possible to generate aggregate movement levels very similar to those found in an actual building context.},

  Abstract                 = {Navigation is an innate ability for humans, but simulating this capability in a virtual environment is no easy task and has been of interest to researchers for over a decade. This paper describes the development of ISAPT, an individual-based Intermodal Simulator for the Analysis of Pedestrian Traffic. ISAPT's development is based on the observed behaviors of pedestrians reported from the literature and simulates the strategies employed by pedestrians for collision avoidance, including changes in speed and trajectory, passing strategies, and distance between objects. The implementation of these behaviors and strategies is described in the paper along with the results from a validation study. These results illustrate that the micro-level simulation of individual pedestrians gives ISAPT the ability to reproduce identified macrolevel pedestrian behavior, as well as the capability to reproduce the operational statistics of an observed pedestrian corridor. Such functionality is necessary to support the use of simulation as a tool for designers and planners in the design and evaluation of intermodal facilities.},

Recent genomic and functional studies suggest that five cargo-carrying motors emerged in primitive eukaryotes and have been widely used throughout evolution. The complexity of these Toolbox motors expanded in higher eukaryotes through gene duplication, alternative splicing, and the addition of associated subunits, which enabled new cargoes to be transported. Remarkably, fungi, parasites, plants, and animals have distinct subsets of Toolbox motors in their genomes, suggesting an underlying diversity of strategies for intracellular transport.},

  Abstract                 = {Public transit plays an important role in emergency evacuations, particularly for areas where public transit serves as a major commute mode for commuters. Microsimulation techniques provide great flexibility in assessing different scenarios in emergency situations. Combining GIS-based network analysis with microsimulation techniques, this study developed a framework to simulate emergency evacuations using rail transit. Applying the framework to a hypothetical attack on the Pentagon, this study investigated the performance of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit AuthorityÃ¢Â€Â™s Metrorail for large-scale evacuations. A network-based analysis was performed to estimate the number of riders in association with each metro line and station. Using VISSIM, a multi-mode micro-simulation software package, this study integrated a pedestrian model with a Metrorail transit model to evaluate the performance of the Metrorail in the hypothetical evacuations. The simulation results suggested that if the potential of Metrorail transit is effectively utilized, it could be very useful resource during a large-scale evacuation. This study demonstrated the great potential and flexibility of microsimulation techniques for evaluating complex evacuation scenarios and strategies. The framework and approach used in this study can be applied to analyze other similar situations and help develop effective evacuation plans.},

rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that
are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are
useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems
consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the es-
tablishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated,
that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equi-
librium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living)
units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the
transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and
algebraic divergences.},

It has been experimentally observed that humans accomplish the task of way-finding a destination in an unknown environment by recognizing landmarks. Investigations using network analytic techniques reveal that humans, when asked to way-find their destination, learn the top ranked nodes of a network. In this paper we report a study simulating the strategy used by humans to recognize the centers of a network. We show that the paths obtained from our simulation has the same properties as the paths obtained in human based experiment. The simulation thus performed leads to a novel way of path-finding in a network. We discuss the performance of our method and compare it with the existing techniques to find a path between a pair of nodes in a network.},

Pedestrians' behaviour violated another common assumption used in traffic analysis - tha individuals do not anticipate visible changes in downstream conditions and therefore change their speeds only at shockwave boundaries.

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the relationships among pedestrian speed, flow, and density is essential for improving the design and operation of pedestrian facilities. Seven established models relating speed to density for vehicular flow were tested against a set of pedestrian data. The seven models were Greenshields (single-regime linear), May's bell-shaped curve, Underwood's transposed exponential curve, Greenberg's modified exponential curve, Edie's discontinuous exponential form, two-regime linear, and three-regime linear. The evaluation procedure closely follows that developed by Drake, Schofer, and May in 1967. The study site was near the entrance to a pedestrian tunnel that caused a single, extensive queue. The walkway portion closest to the tunnel had a capacity equal to or slightly greater than the tunnel. Pedestrian demand at the location increased from near zero to over capacity and then returned to near zero. Flow parameters were derived from videotape. The performance of each model is described both by the results of statistical tests and by visual examination of the flow-density-speed curves. The three-regime linear model was not found to be statistically significant. Of the three one-regime models, the bell-shaped was judged to be superior to the Greenshields and Underwood models because of its better predictions of optimum density and optimum speed. Of the three two-regime linear models, the Edie was judged best on the basis of statistical tests and predictions of flow parameters. Since two distinct regimes were found, the Edie model was deemed to be the best model for this data set.},

  Abstract                 = {The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with periodic boundary conditions is investigated for shuffled dynamics. In this type of update, in each discrete timestep the particles are updated in a random sequence. Such an update is important for several applications, e.g., for certain models of pedestrian flow in two dimensions. For the ASEP with shuffled dynamics and a related truncated process exact results are obtained for deterministic motion (p = 1). Since the shuffled dynamics is intrinsically stochastic, also this case is nontrivial. For the case of stochastic motion (0 < p < 1) it is shown that, in contrast to all other updates studied previously, the ASEP with shuffled update does not have a product measure steady state. Approximative formulae for the steady-state distribution and fundamental diagram are derived that are in very good agreement with simulation data.},

  Abstract                 = {For centuries, how an object moves given external forces is 
characterized by physical laws. As for creatures like human, 
their movements are self­driven, and the driving forces are 
generated by intention of people in a psychological sense. How 
to capture this characteristic in consistency with known physics 
laws is meaningful to understand human behaviors. 
By investigating a Newtonian­like model of a pedestrian, this 
paper presents a fluid­like model of crowd, showing that the 
physical concept of energy is also suited for psychological study

of human collective behaviors. An energy balance equation is 
derived to characterize how the energy is transformed between 
the psychological forms and physical forms: the psychological 
drive arises as a potential form of energy, which aims at either 
accelerating or compressing a crowd as transformed to energy 
in physical forms (e.g., kinetic energy or static energy). If such

transformation cannot be realized, disorder of the crowd may 
appear as a possible result. 
Based on our energy­based analysis, a major gap is bridged 
among physical models, psychological findings and simulation 
results, and an insight is further presented to understand the 
paradoxical relationship of subjective wishes of human and 
objective result of their deeds in reality.},

  Abstract                 = {The pedestrians can only avoid collisions passively under the action of forces during simulations using the social force model, which may lead to unnatural behaviors. This paper proposes an optimization-based model for the avoidance of collisions, where the social repulsive force is removed in favor of a search for the quickest path to destination in the pedestrian’s vision field. In this way, the behaviors of pedestrians are governed by changing their desired walking direction and desired speed. By combining the critical factors of pedestrian movement, such as positions of the exit and obstacles and velocities of the neighbors, the choice of desired velocity has been rendered to a discrete optimization problem. Therefore, it is the self-driven force that leads pedestrians to a free path rather than the repulsive force, which means the pedestrians can actively avoid collisions. The new model is verified by comparing with the fundamental diagram and actual data. The simulation results of individual avoidance trajectories and crowd avoidance behaviors demonstrate the reasonability of the proposed model.},

Assuming escaping behavior of individuals in emergency is rational rather than out of panic according to recent findings in social psychology, we investigate the behavioral evolution of large crowds from the perspective of evolutionary game theory. Specifically, evolution of the whole population divided into two subpopulations, namely the co-evolution of strategy and game structure, is numerically simulated based on the game theoretical models built and the evolutionary rule designed, and a series of phenomena including extinction of one subpopulation and herding effect are predicted in the proposed framework. Furthermore, if the rewarding for rational agents becomes significantly larger than that for emotional ones, herding effect will disappear. It is exciting that some phase transition points with interesting properties for the system can be found. In addition, our model framework is able to explain the fact that it is difficult for mavericks to prevail in society. The current results of this work will be helpful in understanding and restraining herding effect in real life. },

Results show the following: evacuation assistants clearly exhibit a centripetal effect and lead role, as recognized by evacuees; evacuation efficiency has a linear relationship with the number of evacuees that an evacuation assistant can lead; when an evacuation assistant leads more evacuees, evacuation efficiency is higher; an evacuation assistantâ€™s efficiency is directly related to his initial position and speed; evacuation assistants should move slower than evacuees; efficiency is strongly correlated with an assistantâ€™s initial distance from a designated exit, the optimal value for which is provided. },

  Abstract                 = {When more than one pedestrian want to move to the same site, conflicts appear and thus the involved pedestrians play a motion game. In order to describe the emergence of cooperation during the conflict resolving process, an evolutionary cellular automation model is established considering the effect of aspiration and mean gain. In each game, pedestrian may be gentle cooperator or aggressive defector. We propose a set of win-stay-lose-shrift (WSLS) like rules for updating pedestrian's strategy. These rules prescribe that if the mean gain of current strategy between some given steps is larger than aspiration the strategy keeps, otherwise the strategy changes. The simulation results show that a high level aspiration will lead to more cooperation. With the increment of the statistic length, pedestrians will be more rational in decision making. It is also found that when the aspiration level is small enough and the statistic length is large enough all the pedestrian will turn to defectors. We use the prisoner's dilemma model to explain it. At last we discuss the effect of aspiration on fundamental diagram.},

  Abstract                 = {An evacuation exercise without previous notice was arranged with over 600 participants in September 1995 at a leading theatre during a dress rehearsal of an upcoming play. The exercise was organized by the theatre in co-operation with fire authorities and an insurance company.
The exercise was started shortly before the end of the first act of the play when the fire drop-curtain of the stage went down and a pre-recorded announcement was read over the public announcement system. No smoke or other effects were used. The audience left the auditorium in an orderly fashion and the auditorium was completely evacuated in 3 min 37 s. Everyone left the auditorium through the normal entrance. No signs of panic were observed during the evacuation. The personnel of the theatre carried out their duties planned for emergency situations without any complications. After the exercise, the response of the audience was very positive, but a number of the actors were quite upset and requested the theatre management never to organize such exercises while they were on stage.
The quantitative data of the evacuation exercise have been used to assess various kinds of calculation methods, one of which is a traditional hand-calculation method and four generally available computer models. Of the computer programs one is an optimization model while three are different simulation models. The results show that the calculations concerning the movement phase of the evacuation are in reasonable agreement with the observations from the exercise.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The floor field model has been widely used to study pedestrian movement. But the traditional methods of setting the static floor field would lead to highly insufficient utilization of the exit region when the exit width is very large. In order to solve the problem and to study the utilization of wide exit, in this paper we put forward an idea of â€œvirtual reference pointâ€� and propose a new method of building static floor field. A virtual reference point can be regarded as a point sink of the floor field, it has minimum field value. The position of the virtual reference point decides the distribution of static floor field values in the model. We further explore the relationship between the virtual reference point position and the exit width using regression analysis. It seems that a proper position of virtual reference point will make the exit be fully used and get high evacuation efficiency. We then analyze how to lead people to fully utilize the exit by changing the configuration of exit guidance, and give a primary scheme. },

  Abstract                 = {Der �ffentliche Linienverkehr hat im Verkehrsgeschehen Europas, vor allem in jenem der grossen Agglomerationen, bereits einen hohen Stellenwert, der aufgrund der verkehrspolitischen Zielvorgaben der meisten L�nder noch gesteigert werden soll. In den Entwicklungsl�ndern sind zudem Siedlungskonzentrationen von bisher unbekannter Dimension im Entstehen, deren Erschliessung ohne leistungsf�hige �ffentliche Linienverkehrsmittel nicht denkbar ist. Probleme grunds�tzlicher und praktischer Art in der Planung und im Betrieb des �ffentlichen Linienbetriebes bereiten nach wie vor der Fahrgastfluss und die Fahrgastwechselzeit. Die Fahrgastwechselzeit h�ngt von einer Vielzahl von Faktoren ab, so von der Zahl der Fahrg�ste, welche einen Kurs an einer bestimmten Haltestelle besteigen oder verlassen, von der Zahl und der Breite der Fahrzeugt�ren, der H�hendifferenz zwischen Wagenboden und Perron, dem Alter der Fahrg�ste und dem Zweck ihrer Reise, der Tageszeit, der Auslastung des Fahrzeuges usw. Die Studie setzte sich zum Ziel, Modelle zu formulieren, um die Fahrgastwechselzeit zuverl�ssig vorherzusagen, unterschiedliche Fahrzeugkonzepte zu vergleichen und den Fahrgastfluss auf dem Perron und im Fahrzeug zu optimieren.
Das Literaturstudium zu dieser Arbeit umfasst rund 600 Einzeltitel. Experimentell wurden die Fahrgastwechselzeiten und die Ben�tzung der Fahrzeugt�ren bei verschiedenen ausgew�hlten Fahrzeugtypen im praktischen Betrieb gemessen. Einbezogen wurden Fahrzeuge von Fernbahnen und Vorortsbahnen, Strassenbahnfahrzeuge und Autobusse, sowohl mit konventioneller Wagenbodenh�he, als auch Niederflurfahrzeuge. Auf dieser Basis wurde ein Computerprogramm entwickelt, welches es gestattet, die Fahrgastwechselzeit je nach Fahrzeugkonzept und Einstiegsgestaltung mittels wahrscheinlichkeitstheoretischer Gesetzm�ssigkeiten allgemein zu berechnen.
Als Ergebnis der Untersuchungen ist es gelungen, die Einflussgr�ssen zu typisieren und deren Wirkung auf die Fahrgastwechselzeit qualitativ und quantitativ zu erfassen. Tageszeit- und fahrgastabh�ngige Einfl�sse wirken sich demnach nicht unwesentlich auf die Dauer des Fahrgastwechsels aus. Die Leistungsf�higkeit der Fahrzeugt�ren ist linear von ihrer Breite abh�ngig. Je breiter eine T�re ist, desto gr�sser wird aber auch die relative Streuung der Fahrgastwechselzeit, bezogen auf den Mittelwert. Durch einen ebenerdigen Einstieg l�sst sich die Fahrgastwechselzeit gegen�ber einem Treppeneinstieg um rund 40 % vermindern. Die Leistungsf�higkeit des T�rsystems eines Fahrzeuges oder Zuges ist in erster N�herung gleich der Summe der Leistungsf�higkeiten der Einzelt�ren. Die Effizienz des T�rsystems sinkt indessen mit wachsender Zahl der T�ren und mit steigender Streuung an der Einzelt�re. Die Verl�ngerung der Fahrgastwechselzeit infolge ungleichm�ssiger Verteilung der Fahrg�ste auf die T�ren wird quantifiziert. Zur Vorausberechnung der Fahrgastwechselzeit einer ganzen Fahrt wird aufbauend auf diesen Erkenntnissen ein einfaches Sch�tzverfahren entwickelt.
Abschliessend werden Folgerungen bez�glich der am Fahrgastwechsei beteiligten Systemkomponenten Fahrgast, feste Anlagen, Fahrzeug und Betrieb abgeleitet. Es wird nachgewiesen, dass bei gegebener Gesamtt�rbreite mit vielen schmalen T�ren k�rzere Fahrgastwechselzeiten erreicht werden als mit wenigen breiten. Es wird gezeigt, unter welchen Umst�nden dank g�nstiger Einstiegsverh�ltnisse ein Kurs eingespart werden kann und in welchem Ausmass gleichzeitig die Stabilit�t des Linienbetriebes verbessert wird.},

In this paper we study the problem of planning high-quality paths. A high-quality path should have some desirable properties: it should be short, avoiding long detours, and at the same time it should stay at a safe distance from the obstacles, namely it should have clearance. We suggest a quality measure for paths, which balances between the above criteria of
minimizing the path length while maximizing its clearance. We analyze the properties of optimal paths according to our measure, and devise an approximation algorithm to compute near-optimal paths amidst polygonal obstacles in the plane. We also apply our quality measure to corridors. Instead of planning a one-dimensional motion path for a moving entity, it is often more convenient to let the entity move in a corridor, where the exact motion path is determined by a local planner. We show that planning an optimal corridor is equivalent
to planning an optimal path with bounded clearance.},

It evolves from the visibility graph to the Voronoi diagram as the parameter c grows from 0 to \infinity. This diagram can be used for planning natural-looking paths for a robot translating amidst polygonal obstacles in the plane. A natural-looking path is short, smooth, and keeps - where possible - an amount of clearance c from the obstacles. The VV(c)-diagram contains such paths. We also propose an algorithm that is capable of preprocessing a scene of configuration-space polygonal obstacles and constructs a data structure called the VV-complex. The VV-complex can be used to efficiently plan motion paths for any start and goal configuration and any clearance value c, without having to explicitly
construct the VV(c)-diagram for that c-value. The preprocessing time is O(n2 log n), where n is the total number of obstacle vertices, and the data structure can be queried directly for any c-value by merely performing a Dijkstra search. We have implemented a CGAL-based software package for computing the VV(c)-diagram in an exact manner for a given clearance value and used it to plan natural-looking paths in various applications.},

This model can simulate pedestrian movement with different walk velocities through update at different time-step intervals. Two kinds of boundary conditions including periodic and open boundary for pedestrian counter flow are considered, and their dynamical characteristics are discussed. Simulation results show that for periodic boundary condition there are three phases of pedestrian patterns, i.e., freely moving phase, lane formation phase, and perfectly stopped phase at some certain total density ranges. In the stage of lane formation, the phenomenon that pedestrians exceed those with lower walk velocity through a narrow walkway can be found. For open boundary condition, at some certain entrance densities, there are two steady states of pedestrian patterns; but the first is metastable. Spontaneous fluctuations can break the first steady state, i.e., freely moving phase, and run into the second steady state, i.e., perfectly stopped phase.},

This model can be successfully applied to simulate real world scenarios in pedestrian movement.

A simulation software has been implemented that can handle multiple floors in real 3-dimensional buildings and other nontrivial geometries, e.g. columns and angular walls. All parameters that influence pedestrian movement can be adjusted in a way the simulation results match available empirical data.

Die Ursache hierf\"ur liegt mit in der Tatsache, da{\ss} bei der besonderen Art dieses Verkehrs Gesetzm\"a{\ss}igkeiten schwierig zu ermitteln sind und zur gesicherten Fomulierung eines umfangreichen statistischen Materials bed\"urfen. Mit wachsender Planungs- und Baut\"atigkeit von Anlagen des \"offentlichen Nahverkehrs, der seine ARt nach \"uberwiegend ein Massenverkehr ist, gewinnt die Forderung an Bedeutung, diejenigen Anlagen im Schienenverkehr, die st\"andig von allen Reisenden als Fu{\ss}g\"anger benutzt werden (Bahnsteig, Treppen, Tunnel) zweckm\"a{\ss}ig und ausreichend zu bemessen.

In der vorliegenden Arbeit wird der massierte Fu{\ss}g\"angerverkehr innerhalb von Bahnhofsanlagen, der vorwiegend im Berufsverkehr auftritt, mit seinen wichtigen Merkmalen wie z.B. Dichte und Geschwindigkeit, untersucht mit dem Ziel, Bemessungsgrundlagen f\"ur die von Fu{\ss}g\"angern stark frquentierten baulichen Anlagen bez\"uglich ihrer Kapazit\"at zu gewinnen. Der Verfasser hat hierzu umfangreiche Messungen mit Hilfe eines zeitabh\"angigen Tonbandz\"ahlverfahrens auf Bahnhofsanlagen mit starkem Berufsverkehr durchgef\"uhrt. F\"ur die Untersuchung von Stauerscheinungen auf den Verkehrsanlagen wurde ein fotografisches Aufnahmeverfahren verwendet. Die Auswertung und statistischen Untersuchungen der gro{\ss}en Datenmengen, die s\"amtlich auf Lochkarten fixiert wurden, verlangten den Einsatz einer elektronischen Gro{\ss}-Rechenanlage und die Aufstellung einer Reihe spezieller Rechenprogramme in der Programmsprache ALGOL. Bei der Auswertung stellte sich heraus, da{\ss} viele SDachverhalte durch korrelative lineare Beziehungen zwischen zwei Ver\"anderlichen beschrieben werden k\"onnen.

Ein besonderer Abschnitt der Arbeit befa{\ss}t sich mit der \"Uberlagerung von Aussteigerstr\"omen zweier Z\"uge am gleichen Bahnsteig. Hierbei werden Haltexzentrizit\"at und Ankunftsunp\"unktlichkeit der Z\"uge mit im praktischen Betrieb gemessenen Verteilungen ber\"ucksichtigt, indem die \"uberlagerung der Aussteigegerstr\"ome in Abh\"angigkeit von diesen Variablen und anderen Parametern simuliert werden.

Although there are many different studies about this relation, even so for the qualitative shape there is still no agreement. To enhance the empirical database we performed experiments with up to 107 test persons under laboratory conditions to study local densities, speeds and flow in planar corridors. Due to new methods of digital image processing our analysis is based on data (trajectories) of very high accuracy. In this contribution we present an extract of our current studies concerning speed, density and flow in planar corridors. We also show effects on results by different measurement procedures. We used different sizes of measurement areas to determine the influence of this parameter. In particular the density where speed reaches zero
due to overcrowding is sensitive to this variation.},

  Abstract                 = {The design procedures of Nelson in the SFPE Handbook [1] and Predtetchenskii & Milinskii (PM) [2] are frequently used for capacity analysis of pedestrian facilities, e.g. egress routes. Both agree that congestion occurs in front of a bottleneck, if the incoming ow exceeds the capacity. However, in case of a present congestion in front of a bottleneck, their approaches differ considerably. Nelson assumes that in this case the ow inside a bottleneck is determined by the bottleneck capacity. PM instead expect that the density in front of the entrance to the bottleneck is signicant higher than the density, which is attributed to the capacity, and thus the ow inside is lower than the capacity. Furthermore PM assume that the density inside is generally significant lower than the density in front of the bottleneck. To resolve these discrepancies we studied the pedestrian ow through a bottleneck [3] as well as the density and the jam occurrence in front of a bottleneck [4] by an experiment performed under laboratory conditions. The aim was to get reliable data concerning the density directly in front of and inside the bottleneck and thereby to check the assumptions of Nelson and Predtetchenskii & Milinskii. We found out that during the stationary state the density in front of the bottleneck does not depend on the bottleneck width b for 0:8m < b < 1:2m. In conformance with PM the density inside is significantly lower than in front of the bottleneck. In reference to the continuity equation these results cast doubts on the assumption of Nelson that the ow through a bottleneck maintains the value of the capacity if a congestion appears in front of the bottleneck.},

Their movements were video recorded, and macroscopic quantities such as speed, density, and flow were extracted to calibrate the model of bidirectional pedestrian streams. All of the parameters of the calibrated model are statistically significant at the 0.1 % level.},

  Abstract                 = {According to the intra-vehicle interaction, a traffic flow can generally be divided into three homogeneous states (1) that of free driving, (2) that of bunched driving, and (3) that of standing. The parameter describing the state of free driving is the desired speed, for the state of bunching it is the intra-vehicle gaps (time headway) within the convoy and the mean speed of the convoy, and for the state of standing it is the maximum jam density. These are the most essential parameters which do not depend on the actual traffic situation.
This paper introduces a new model which considers the Fundamental Diagram (equilibrium speed-flow-density relationship) as a function of the homogeneous states. All traffic situations in reality can be considered as combinations of the homogeneous states and therefore can be described by the essential parameters mentioned above. The non-congested (fluid) traffic is a combination (superposition) of the states of free driving and bunched driving, the congested (jam, stop, and go) traffic is a combination of the states of bunched driving (go) and standing (stop). The contribution of the traffic states within the differently congested traffic situations can then be easily obtained from the queuing and probability theory. As a result, Fundamental Diagram in all equilibrium traffic situations is derived as simple functions of the essential parameters.
According to the new model the capacity of freeways and rural highways can be determined by measuring the essential parameters. This is much easier than measuring the capacity directly. 
Furthermore, the probabilities of the various traffic states can be obtained from the new model. This leads to new possibilities in real-time controlling and telematics.
The new model is verified by comprehensive measurements carried out on freeways and rural highways in Germany.},

A pedestrian chooses a route based on his or her memory of the shortest path to the desired destination when the facility is empty and, at the same time, tries to avoid high densities. In this model, pedestrian flow is governed by a two-dimensional conservation law, and a general speed-flow-density relationship is considered. The model equation is solved numerically using the discontinuous Galerkin method, and a numerical example is employed to demonstrate both the model and the effectiveness of the numerical method.},

  Abstract                 = {An alternative floor field (FF) model is proposed by incorporating the agitated behavior and elastic characteristics of pedestrians. The agitated behavior which is regarded as an important factor to pedestrian dynamics is depicted by introducing a parameter to revise the transition probability of pedestrians to move to the neighboring cells. To characterize elasticity of pedestrians, it is assumed that a cell can hold more than one pedestrians in crowd condition, while it can hold only one pedestrian in normal condition. In addition, a method to deal with conflicts is employed by considering the effects of agitated behavior and desired velocity. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate pedestrian evacuation from a room. The results show, that as the value of agitated parameter increases, the evacuation time decreases to the minimum value and then increases gradually. Also, the faster-is-slower effect which is obtained by some other simulation models can be reproduced by the proposed model. Finally, the influence of exit width and the corresponding mechanism on evacuation process is investigated which is expected to be helpful to the exit design of public rooms.},

  Abstract                 = {The author examined macroscopic behavioral patterns in a crowd of pedestrians in a large crosswalk from the perspective of micro-macro linkage in collective behavior. Study 1 developed a macrolevel index to evaluate by field observation a ''banded structure'' of a pedestrian crowd. The index distinguished 2 patterns of crowd behavior: one with a firmly established structure and one without a clear structure. To examine the formation of the structure, Study 2 used a computer simulation model of pedestrian behavior with a close relationship between the microlevel behavior of individuals and macrolevel behavior of crowds. The micro-macro linkage is expressed through feeding the macrolevel index developed in Study 1 back into a behavioral model for each pedestrian. The results show that models without the linkage between the 2 levels tend to simulate disorganized crowd behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, two important factors which affect the pedestrian outflow at a bottleneck significantly are studied in detail to analyze the effect of an obstacle set up in front of an exit. One is a conflict at an exit when pedestrians evacuate from a room. We use floor field model for simulating such behavior, which is a well-studied pedestrian model using cellular automata. The conflicts have been taken into account by the friction parameter. However, the friction parameter so far is a constant and does not depend on the number of the pedestrians conflicting at the same time. Thus, we have improved the friction parameter by the frictional function, which is a function of the number of the pedestrians involved in the conflict. Second, we have newly introduced the cost of turning of pedestrians at the exit. Since pedestrians have inertia, their walking speeds decrease when they turn, and the pedestrian outflow decreases. The validity of the extended model, which includes the frictional function and the turning function, is verified by both a mean field theory and experiments. In our experiments, the pedestrian flow increases when we put an obstacle in front of an exit. The analytical results clearly explains the mechanism of the effect of the obstacle, i.e., the obstacle blocks pedestrians moving to the exit and decreases the average number of pedestrians involved in the conflict. We have also found that an obstacle works more effectively when we shift it from the center since pedestrians go through the exit with less turning.},

In order to study the flow in detail, the floor field model, which is a crowd model using cellular automata, is extended by taking into account realistic behavior of pedestrians around the exit. The model is studied by both numerical simulations and cluster analysis to obtain a theoretical expression for the average pedestrian flow through the exit. It is found quantitatively that the effects of exit door width, the wall, and the pedestrian mood of competition or cooperation significantly influence the average flow. The results show that there is a suitable width and position of the exit according to the pedestrians' mood.},

However, in our walking-distance introduced queueing model, we have examined that mean waiting time in Parallel becomes smaller when both the arrival probability of pedestrians and the effect of walking distance are large. Moreover, enhanced Forks, which shorten waiting time by reducing the effect of walking distance, are considered, and parts of our results are also verified by real queueing experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {People prefer to walk on the right-hand side of the road for physical and social reasons. In this paper, pedestrian counter-flow in a channel is simulated with the Cellular Automata (CA) Model, with focus on right-preference. Two types of pedestrians are taken into account, walking leftward and rightward along the channel. Circular and open boundaries are adopted respectively. The right-preference intensity, k, is introduced, defined as the ratio of the right-moving probability to left-moving probability. In simulations, the dynamical transition between fluid and jammed phase is presented. With a fixed k, the critical density is independent of the channel size. According to research results on physiology and sociology [O. Guentuerkuen, Nature 421 (2003) 711; M. Reiss, G. Reiss, Percept. Mot. Skill 85 (1997) 569; M.C. Corballis, Psychol. Rev. 104 (1997) 714], k=1,2,8 have been discussed, and k=8 is satisfied in this work. Furthermore, simulation results are compared with the ideal calculation, and other researchers' experiments [M. Isobe, T. Adachi, T. Nagatani, Physica A 336 (2004) 638]. It is found that right-preference is effective when the density is below critical. The model is shown to be useful to simulate and analyze this situation numerically.},

Basic data concerning daily movement when classes were over and an evacuation drill for college students was collected through analysis of video observation. From the analysis, the following conclusions can be given: some typical characteristics of pedestrian movement in staircases were found, such as queuing behavior at platform, merging flow at staircase entrance, and subgroup behavior. Movement on stairs was markedly slower than the horizontal motions. In normal condition, the number and initial speed of students entering the staircase affected observably the pedestrians flow, and the impact of staircase attributes (riser, tread, slope, etc.) cannot be neglected. In different conditions, the characteristics of pedestrian movement were quite different, and the influence of the speed on the density was more significant in the emergency condition. The study highlighted the amassment phenomenon at the bottom of the staircase and the potential influence of stair widths to evacuation efficiency in evacuation drill.},

Many interesting phenomena during real evacuation, such as incoherence, jamming, gathering, backtracking and waiting, are simulated by the variation of the building structure, the occupants' arrangement, the kin attraction and the route selection. We conclude that the psychology of going with the crowd is not always harmful; the conclusions about the kin behavior in one-exit case are the same as those in two-exits case; the number of the sub-groups and the members in each sub-group influence the evacuation efficiency a lot; the typical phenomena of waiting and backtracking in real evacuation do reduce the evacuation efficiency.

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the concept of composite agents to effectively model complex agent interactions for agent-based crowd simulation. Each composite agent consists of a basic agent that is associated with one or more proxy agents. This formulation allows an agent to exercise influence over other agents greater than that implied by its physical properties. Composite agents can be added to most agent-based simulation systems and used to model emergent behaviors among individuals. In practice, there is negligible overhead of introducing composite agents in the simulation. We highlight their application to modeling aggression, social priority, authority, protection and guidance in complex scenes.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the fact that significant investment has been made to install automated pedestrian movement systems within airport terminals, little is known about their effects on airport pedestrian flows. Specifically, while walking speeds of pedestrians have been studied in general, such analysis specific to airport passengers has been lacking. New insight into the walking speeds of airport pedestrians is provided. Corridors with and without moving walkways, the most common of airport automated pedestrian movement systems, are considered. Pedestrian movements in various airport terminal corridors are empirically observed, and observed walking speeds are compared with those of research performed in other transportation terminals. Furthermore, the effects on walking speeds of observable characteristics of pedestrians and the surrounding environment are investigated. The effect of moving walkways on pedestrian walking speeds is examined. A methodology for estimating the travel time of pedestrians on moving walkways under various traffic-flow conditions is derived. Application of the methodology using empirically collected data reveals interesting results about the movement of pedestrians through corridors with moving walkways. The analysis presented may be used to estimate expected travel times in airport corridors, and to examine the effects of potential infrastructure investments on such times. The goal of such an analysis is to improve the quality of service at the airport terminal, particularly for the pedestrians who traverse its corridors.},

A quantitative analysis of the crowd flowing out of a hall shows that the average leaving time T is a function of the exit width W in negative power. The related simulation indicates that the proposed model is able to reproduce the self-organization phenomena of lane formation for sparse flows.},

However, turbulent crowd motion is not reproduced well by current many-particle models due to their insufficient representation of the local interactions in areas of extreme densities. In this contribution, we extend the repulsive force term of the social force model to reproduce crowd turbulence. We perform numerical simulations of pedestrians moving through a bottleneck area with this model. The transitions from laminar to stop-and-go and turbulent flows are observed. The empirical features characterizing crowd turbulence, such as the structure function and the probability density function of velocity increments, are reproduced well; i.e., they are well compatible with an analysis of video data during the annual Muslim pilgrimage.},

A special technique is introduced to compute two basic dynamic parameters: Direction-parameter and Empty-parameter considering the effects of pedestrian jam around exits and the width of exits on evacuation path selection in order to reduce evacuation imbalance caused by the asymmetry of exits layout. Two new coefficients: cognition coefficient and imbalance coefficient are introduced to respectively describe pedestrian cognitive ability and the layout imbalance of exits. The simulation results of the improved and original models are compared and analyzed. Simulation results show that evacuation time depends on the cognition coefficient and imbalance coefficient under normal evacuation condition with reasonable pedestrian. It is also found that there are phase transitions and critical points in the simulation curves of evacuation time against cognition coefficient and that the pedestrian flow shows distinctive characteristics at different phases. The values of critical cognition coefficient points depend on the initial pedestrian density and imbalance coefficient.},

  Abstract                 = {A modified version of the existing cellular automata (CA) model is proposed to simulate an evacuation procedure in a classroom with and without obstacles. Based on the numerous literature on the implementation of CA in modeling evacuation motions, it is notable that most of the published studies do not take into account the pedestrian's ability to select the exit route in their models. To resolve these issues, we develop a CA model incorporating a probabilistic neural network for determining the decision-making ability of the pedestrians, and simulate an exit-selection phenomenon in the simulation. Intelligent exit-selection behavior is observed in our model. From the simulation results, it is observed that occupants tend to select the exit closest to them when the density is low, but if the density is high they will go to an alternative exit so as to avoid a long wait. This reflects the fact that occupants may not fully utilize multiple exits during evacuation. The improvement in our proposed model is valuable for further study and for upgrading the safety aspects of building designs.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last few decades, several approaches for modeling of pedestrian traffic have
been proposed and developed. However, the existing empirical data are insufficient and
have large discrepancies, which makes difficult for the quantitative validation of models,
design and safety assessment of facilities.
This thesis mainly analyze the pedestrian fundamental diagram describing the relation
between crowd density, velocity and flow based on series of well-controlled laboratory
experiments. The second chapter reviews the commonly used fundamental diagrams in
handbooks. The differences and influence of them on facility designs are compared. Then
the existing empirical studies on pedestrian fundamental diagrams are discussed especially
for uni- and bidirectional pedestrian streams.
In the third chapter, the experiment setup and the extraction of the pedestrian trajectories
from video recordings are described. Four different measurement methods are taken to
calculate the crowd density, velocity and specific flow. Their influences on the fundamental
diagram are tested with the data obtained from the experiment of unidirectional flow. For
the density ranges achieved in the experiment, minor effects are observed but the Voronoi
method is able to resolve a finer structure of the diagram and to reveal a discontinuity.
The fourth chapter deals with the analysis of experiments of uni-, bi-directional and
merging flow based on the Voronoi method. The first two experiments were carried out in a
straight corridor, whereas the third one were performed in a T-junction. The topographical
information for density, velocity and specific flow, from which the boundary effect are observed,
are extracted with Voronoi method. The specific concept is applicable to all types
of flows in the density ranges observed in the experiments. Surprisingly, no difference is
found for the fundamental diagrams of bidirectional flow with different modes of order.
However, there is a sharp distinction between the fundamental diagrams of uni- and bidirectional
flow. For the merging flow in a T-junction, the fundamental diagrams measured
in front and behind the merging show also significant differences.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The results of a systematic quantitative validation of \{PEDFLOW\} based on the experimental data from \{FZJ\} are presented. Uni- directional flow experiments, totaling 28 different combinations with varying entry, corridor and exit widths, were considered. The condition imposed on \{PEDFLOW\} was that all the cases should be run with the same input parameters. The exit times and fundamental diagrams for the measuring region were evaluated and compared. This validation process led to modifications and enhancements of the model underlying PEDFLOW. The preliminary conclusions indicate that the results agree well for densities smaller than 3 m-2 and a good agreement is observed even at high densities for the corridors with bcor = 2.4 m, and bcor = 3.0 m. For densities between 1 and 2 m-2 the specific flow and velocities are underpredicted by PEDFLOW. },

  Abstract                 = {In this study, series of experiments under laboratory conditions were carried out to investigate pedestrian flow through a T-junction, i.e., two branches merging into the main stream. The whole duration of the experiments was recorded by video cameras and the trajectories of each pedestrian were extracted using the software Petrack from these videos. The Voronoi method is used to resolve the fine structure of the fundamental diagram and spatial dependence of the measured quantities from trajectories. In our study, only the data in the stationary state are used by analyzing the time series of density and velocity. The density, velocity and specific flow profiles are obtained by refining the size of the measurement area (here 10 cm \times 10 cm are adopted). With such a high resolution, the spatial distribution of density, velocity and specific flow can be obtained separately and the regions with higher value can be observed intuitively. Finally, the fundamental diagrams of T-junction flow is compared in three different locations. It is shown that the fundamental diagrams of the two branches match well. However, the velocities in front of the merging are significantly lower than that in the main stream at the same densities. After the merging, the specific flow increases with the density \rho till 2.5 m-2. While in the branches, the specific flow is almost independent of the density between \rho = 1.5 m-2 and 3.5 m-2},

But the empirical databases for quantitative calibration are still insufficient, e.g. the fundamental diagram as one of the most important relationships displays non-negligible differences among various studies. To improve this situation, experiments in straight corridors and T-junctions are performed. Four different measurement methods are defined to study their effects on the fundamental
diagram. It is shown that they have minor influences for \rho < 3.5 m-2 but only the Voronoi method is able to resolve the fine structure of the fundamental diagram. This enhanced measurement method permits us to observe the occurrence of a boundary-induced phase transition. For corridors of different widths we found that the specific flow concept works well for \rho < 3.5 m-2. Moreover, we illustrate the discrepancies between the fundamental diagrams of a T-junction and a straight corridor.},

We compare the fundamental characteristics of bicycle traffic with that of car and pedestrian traffic, which have been studied extensively in previous research under similar condition. From the comparison of the time-space diagrams of these three one-dimensional traffic flows, different states of motion (free flow state, the jammed state and stop-and-go waves) can be observed in all these systems. The fundamental diagrams are compared in two different ways. Without considering the size and free velocity of these three kinds of objects, the data points occupy different density ranges in the diagram. However, when we use the concept of scaling by considering the free velocity and size of the moving objects, the fundamental diagrams show the same structure and values. This implies that the transport properties in these three different types of single file traffic flow could be unified in a certain range by simple scaling. These results provide insights into the dynamics but also may be relevant for the improvement of mixed traffic systems. },

In this contribution we analyze empirically how the types of the changes or disturbances influence the capacity of a facility. For this purpose four types of facilities including a short narrowing, a long narrowing, a corner and a T-junction are investigated. It is found that the reduction of pedestrian flow depends on the shape and the length of the narrowing. The maximum observed flow of the corner (about 1.45 (m s)-1) is the lowest in all facilities studied, whereas that of the short narrowing is highest. The finding indicates that the usage of an unique fundamental diagram for the description of pedestrian flow at different kind of geometrical narrowings is limited. },

We investigate the video record of the pedestrian movement in the classroom, and find some typical characteristics of the evacuation, including variable velocity, dislocable queuing, monopolizing exit and so on. Based on the experimental observation, we improve the multi-grid model by considering the pre-movement time of each pedestrian, adopting variable velocity and using a new update procedure. With the improved multi-grid model, we simulate the evacuation process and compare the simulation results with the experimental results, and find that they agree with each other closely. In order to analyze the uncertainty of evacuation, we investigate the influences of the pre-movement time and its distribution on the evacuation. It is found that the evacuation times exhibit a (truncated) normal distribution and vary within a region of about 30% of the mean value. An interesting phenomenon is that the evacuation time of the egress experiment is close to the minimum value calculated with the model, due to the coordination among pedestrians during the experiment. The study may be useful in developing applicable egress models and understanding the basic egress behaviors. },

We have performed experiments with single-file motion of bicycles and compared the results with previous studies for car and pedestrian motion in similar setups. In the spaceâ€“time diagrams we observe three different states of motion (free flow state, jammed state and stop-and-go waves) in all these systems. Despite their obvious differences they are described by a universal fundamental diagram after proper rescaling of space and time which takes into account the size and free velocity of the three kinds of agents. This indicates that the similarities between the systems go deeper than expected. },

Three categories of potential fields were defined to model the pedestrian behavior by simulating pedestrians' decision processes. A circumstance potential field was defined to simulate the
desire to targets. Moving and waiting potential fields were defined to model the interaction. Experiments were run for the model validation and coefficient performance verification.
Performances and relationships of sensitivity coefficient, decay coefficient and diffusion coefficient are studied to clarify the effectiveness and flexibility of the presented model in
generating pedestrian movement under a variety of situations. The simulation results show the good performance of the model in reflecting pedestrian interactive behavior.},

Here, a multi-agent method to model the egress patterns of evacuees is combined with a microscopic pedestrian simulation model used to analyze the forces between individuals in a densely populated enclosed space in a crowd crushing and trampling analysis (CroC&Ts). The system is used to model egress patterns in a typical crowd evacuation simulation. The simulations indicate that some individuals will die from crushing in 2 m and 4 m wide exits in emergencies. The simulations also show that the fatality probability increases when barriers obstacled the path and when the egress distances were larger. The simulations validate the conclusions of the stranded crowd model (SCM) and provide quantitative predictions of the crowd crushing and trampling risk. Therefore, the CroC&Ts can provide performance-based egress designs for large pubic buildings and improve crowd safety management and emergency planning.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The mixed bicycle flow refers to the bicycle flow containing electric bicycles. The traffic characteristics data of the mixed bicycle flow was collected by the virtual coil method in Nanjing and Ningbo, China. And the speedâ€“density characteristics of the mixed bicycle flow with different proportions of electric bicycles were obtained. The results show that the overall speed of the mixed bicycle flow containing electric bicycles is higher than that of pure bicycle flow when the density is relatively low. The speed decreases when the density is higher than 0.08Â bic/m2; the speedâ€“density characteristics of the bicycles and the electric bicycles tend to be the same when the density is higher than 0.25Â bic/m2. And when the density reaches 0.58Â bic/m2, the mixed bicycle flow becomes blocked and the speed is zero. The cellular automata model and gas dynamics model were also adopted to simulate the speedâ€“density characteristics of the mixed bicycle flow. The simulation results of the cellular automata model are effectively consistent with the actual survey data when the density is lower than 0.225Â bic/m2; the simulation results of the gas dynamics model are effectively consistent with the actual survey data when the density is higher than 0.300Â bic/m2; but both of the two types of simulation models are inapplicable when the density is between 0.225 and 0.300Â bic/m2. These results will be used in the management of mixed bicycles and the research of vehicleâ€“bicycle conflict and so on.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traveller route choice behaviour is influenced by many uncertain factors, which include both outer stochastic factors from road network and inner factors from traveller psychology. Traveller route choice behaviour is dynamic in practical travel process, namely traveller can change route on the way. Considered the characteristics of bounded rationality in human decision making process and change of route choice on the way, a dynamic route choice model is established based on prospect theory, and the method of dynamic route choice which is more suitable to human thinking habits and actual travel characteristics is proposed in this paper. The method allows the traveller to adjust the route according to road situation at any time. Decision making process reflects that the influence of traveller reference point on the decision result. Reference point changes with the situation of road sections passed. The examples are given to verify the validity and explain application of the method. The result shows that traveller can change route on the way when he meet congestion on the section passed, and if traveller's psychological expected time can not be met, he will choose risky route, by which the probability of congestion is higher. The method describes traveller route choice behaviour process better and reflects the true situation of road network. It is beneficial to predict traveller behaviours and changes of traffic network situation, and have certain guiding significance for traffic network planning and traffic intelligent control. },

  Abstract                 = {The study of crowd behavior is essential for the safe organization of mass events. However, precise quantitative empirical data are insufficient due to the lack of mass event scenarios suitable for observation. In this paper, crowd behavior during a mass event in which many people go through a door and then pass a bridge is studied by a new method based on a flow field visualization algorithm widely used in fluid experiments. Two important movement phases, laminar flow on a bridge and stop-and-go waves in a bottleneck area, are investigated. The results show that the velocity profile on the bridge is similar to that of fully developed laminar flow in a pipe. Quantitative analysis of the stop-and-go wave in the bottleneck area shows that the dominant fluctuation frequencies are mainly below 0.1 Hz and the peak frequency is around 0.05 Hz; the wave propagation speed is about − 0.69 m s−1. The absolute decrease in speed as the wave propagates is also indicated. By a combination of shock wave theory and a fundamental diagram, an analytical model of a shock wave in a crowd is established to theoretically investigate the stop-and-go wave, and the model can be used to explain the measurement results. This study provides a new method and fundamental data for understanding crowd behavior. The results are also expected to be useful for the design of crowd management strategies during mass events.},

  Abstract                 = {Many tragic crowd disasters have happened across the world in recent years, such as Phnom Penh stampede in Cambodia, crowd disaster in Mina/Makkah, Love Parade disaster in Germany, showing management of mass events is a tough task for organizers. Study on unidirectional flow, one of the most common forms of motion in mass activities, is essential for safe organization. In this paper, the properties of unidirectional flow in a crowded street during a real mass event in China are quantitatively investigated with sophisticated active infrared counters and image processing method. Complete data set of flow rate during the whole celebration is recorded, and the time series analysis gives a new insight into such activities. The spatial analysis shows that the velocity and density of crowd are inhomogeneous due to the boundary effect, whereas the flux is uniform. The estimated capacity of street indicates that the maximum flow rate under normal condition should locate between 1.73 and 1.98 m/s, which is in good agreement with several field studies available in the existing literatures. In consideration of the significant deviation among different studies, fundamental diagrams of dense crowd are also re-verified, and the results here are consistent with those from other field studies of unidirectional flow, but different from the bidirectional and experimental results. It is suggested that the data from multidirectional flow and experiments cannot be directly applied to the unidirectional dense flow in real mass event. The results also imply that the density of similar unidirectional marching crowd should be controlled under $5 m^2$, which can produce optimal efficiency and have more possibility to ensure safety. The data of field study shown here can be good compensation for the database on crowd study.},

  Abstract                 = {A modified cellular automata model is proposed to simulate the pedestrian evacuation behavior in a room with multiple exits by considering the reserve capacity of the exit. The main idea is motivated by the original concept of minority game, which means less congested exits may be preferentially chosen together with the floor fields. The model outperforms previous ones under the condition in which pedestrians are distributed heterogeneously. Simulation results show that wise exit choosing with the consideration of
reserve capacity may reduce the evacuation time apparently, which is more realistic. Furthermore, the impacts of the room geometry and parameter settings are investigated extensively.},

The analysis includes the description of the whole process of the disaster, some characteristics of the trample, and with the help of SSM (soft systematic methodology) the factors that led to the disaster, etc. Through the detailed analysis, we conclude that the main causes of the disaster are as follows: the poor estimation of the tourist population, dereliction of duties, deficient communication, and the design fault of the bridge as well. To emphasis the significance of the management on the critical points, quantitative analysis of the crowd gathering process of the disaster were carried out by mathematical model and simulation methods, the results of the two methods are approximately the same. In the trample disaster, asphyxia is the main cause of the death. This paper reports the casualties in the fatality, demonstrating the relationship between the casualty constitution and the force created during the crush.},

For nonspherical particles, the distance of closest approach depends on orientation, and its calculation is surprisingly difficult.

Phys. 58, 409 (1985)], no analytic solutions have been obtained for the distance of closest approach of ellipsoids in three dimensions, or, until now, for ellipses in two dimensions. We have derived an analytic expression for the distance of closest approach of the centers of two arbitrary hard ellipses as a function of their orientation relative to the line joining their centers. We describe our method for solving this problem, illustrate our result, and discuss its usefulness in modeling and simulating systems of anisometric particles such as liquid crystals.},

According to available literatures, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, and conclude that a variety of different kinds of approaches should be combined to study crowd evacuation. Psychological and physiological elements affecting individual and collective behaviors should be also inorporated into the evacuation models.},

  Abstract                 = {Die politischen Entscheidungsträger auf kommunaler Ebene halten vielfach eine
Angebotsplanung für den Radverkehr in topografisch bewegten Siedlungsräumen für
nicht zweckmäßig.
Ursache sind Befürchtungen, daß wegen der zu überwindenden Höhenunterschiede ein
Radverkehrsnetz nur begrenzt angenommen wird und somit den Investitionen ein
relativ geringer Nutzen gegenüber steht.
Dabei wird möglicherweise übersehen, daß mit der neuen Generation von Gangschaltungen
Steigungsstrecken leichter und größere Steigungen überwunden werden können
als früher.
Wesentliches Ziel dieser Arbeit ist die Darstellung der durch die neue Generation von
Gangschaltungen verbesserten Einsatzbedingungen des Fahrrades in topografisch
bewegten Siedlungsräumen.
Die Empfehlungen und Regelwerke zur Radverkehrsplanung sparen Fragestellungen
und Hinweise zur Zweckmäßigkeit einer Angebotsplanung in bewegter Topografie bis
heute aus, so daß im Rahmen dieser Arbeit ein Vorschlag gemacht wird, wie die
Empfehlungen für Radverkehrsanlagen (ERA) ergänzt werden können.
Grundlage für die Ermittlung der Zweckmäßigkeit einer Angebotsplanung sind bei der
hier .entwickelten Methode die Leistungsfähigkeiten (Steigfähigkeit, Geschwindigkeit)
von Bemessungsradfahrern und eine differenzierte Erfassung der Steigungsverhältnisse
im potentiellen Radverkehrsnetz.
Mit diesen Analysedaten werden die Fahr- und Schiebestreckenanteile eines Radverkehrsnetzes
sowie die Geschwindigkeiten der Bemessungsradfahrer auf den Routen
des Netzes bestimmt, aus denen wiederum wird die Zweckmäßigkeit einer Angebotsplanung
abgeleitet.
Anhand der beschriebenen Methodik ist der Planungsraum Remscheid-Lüttringhausen
untersucht worden. Dieser Raum gilt nach Einschätzung der kommunal politischen
Entscheidungsträger als wenig geeignet für den Radverkehr. Die durchgeführten
Analysen und Bewertungen zeigen aber auf, daß eine Angebotsplanung für den
Radverkehr durchaus zweckmäßig sein kann.},

Cars and sand grains have in common, that they interact irreversibly, which is the for similar jamming phenomena. The main difference is that car drivers chosse their destination and route individually, while grains follow external driving forces. This book gives an overview about the progress in modelling, computer simulation, experiments and field observations, which was reached within the last two years. The contributions are based on the International Workshop Traffic and Granular Flow '01, which took place in Nagoya, 15-17 October 2001. Topics include a critical classification of models for highway traffic, new technological applications, friction and arching phenomena in pedestrian traffic, scale free networks and internet traffic, instabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {The world is changing. From shopping malls to transport terminals, aircraft to passenger ships, the infrastructure of society is having to cope with ever more intense and complex flows of people. Today, more than ever, safety, efficience and comfort need to be addressed by all designers.
The World Trade Center disaster brought into tragic focus the need for well-designed evacuation systems.The new regulatory framework (MSC/Circ 1033), in the marine industry, acknowledges not only the importance of ensuring that the built environment is safe, but also the central role that evacuation simulation can play in achieving this. Of course, the effectiveness of design is as much about comfort and efficiency as safety, and combined, these complex demands challenge traditional prescriptive design guides and regulations. Designers and regulators are consequently turning to performance-based analysis and regulation facilitated by the new generation of people movement models.
The development and application of these models was the subject of the Second International Conference on Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics held at the University of Greenwich, UK, 20-22 August, 2003- the only international conference in the world to focus on the modelling an simulation of pedestrian and evacuation dynamics. This book is a record of the proceedings of the conference and contains 34 papers from 12 countries written by the world's leading authorities in the field. It represents a unique opportunity for experts and beginners, model developers and model users, regulators and design engineers to gain insight into the rapidly changing world of computer simulation of pedestrian evacuation dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Is the behaviour of a crowd in an emergency situation predictable? Are the different paterns occurring in pedestrian flow based on common rules? How does panic change human reactions? These and other questions have been scope of the international conference on Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics, held at the Gerhard-Mercator-University Duisburg, Germany, April 4-6, 2001. 
This book contains elaborate manuscripts written by scientists as well as practitioners from various disciplines: architecture, civil, naval and fire safety engineering, physics, computer science and mathematics. It is in the nature of the subject that there are many different approaches to tackle the various aspects of pedestrian movement and evacuation procedures. There has been considerable progress over the last decade and the central topic of human motion and behaviour has come more and more into the centre of interest, mainly due to increasing computer power and the development of new simulation models. This is the first conference dealing with modelling and simulation of pedestrian and crowd movements as well as the dynamical aspects of evacuation processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to an increasing number of reported catastrophes all over the world, the safety especially of pedestrians today, is a dramatically growing field of interest, both for practitioners as well as scientists from various disciplines. The questions arising mainly address the dynamics of evacuating people and possible optimisations of the process by changing the architecture and /or the procedure. This concerns not only the case of ships, stadiums or buildings, all with restricted geometries, but also the evacuation of complete geographical regions due to natural disasters. Furthermore, also 'simple' crowd motion in 'relaxed' situations poses new questions with respect to higher comfort and efficiency since the number of involved persons at large events is as high as never before. In addition, as a new research topic in this field, collective animal behaviour is attracting increasing attention. All this was in the scope of the conference held in Vienna, September 28-30, 2005, the third one in a series after Duisburg (2001) and Greenwich (2003).},

  Abstract                 = {Nach der Musterbauordnung (MBO) in der Fassung vom November 2002 sind bauliche Anlagen so
anzuordnen, zu errichten, zu ändern und instand zu halten, dass die öffentliche Sicherheit und Ord-
nung, insbesondere Leben, Gesundheit und die natürlichen Lebensgrundlagen, nicht gefährdet wer-
den. Des Weiteren müssen bauliche Anlagen so beschaffen sein, dass im Brandfall die Rettung von
Menschen und Tieren sowie wirksame Löscharbeiten möglich sind.
Entsprechende Vorschriften für Versammlungsstätten enthält die Muster-Versammlungsstättenver-
ordnung (MVStättV, in der Fassung vom Juni 2005). Teil 2, Abschnitt 2 der MVStättV behandelt die
Führung und Bemessung von Flucht- und Rettungswegen.
Der § 51 Absatz 7 der MBO erlaubt im Einzelfall für Sonderbauten die Abweichung von den allgemei-
nen Vorschriften hinsichtlich Brandschutzanlagen, -einrichtungen und -vorkehrungen.
Zusätzlich zur Einhaltung bauordnungsrechtlicher Anforderungen zu zulässigen Rettungsweglängen
und notwendigen Ausgangsbreiten sind, insbesondere für Gebäude die planmäßig von einer großen
Anzahl an Personen genutzt werden, Entfluchtungsberechnungen als Teil eines ganzheitlichen
Brandschutzkonzeptes zu empfehlen. Das gleiche gilt für den Fall der Sonderbauten, insbesondere im
Falle der o.g. Abweichungen.
Der Einsatz rechnergestützter Verfahren bei solchen Nachweisen, stellt die Bauaufsichtsbehörden vor
neue Herausforderungen. Insbesondere für die bei einer Fluchtwegeberechnung angenommenen
Szenarien und Parameter sind standardisierte Kriterien notwendig.
Das gleiche gilt für die Beurteilung der Verlässlichkeit und Richtigkeit von Softwareprogrammen.
Die hier vorgelegte Muster-Richtlinie stellt eine Handreichung für die Genehmigungsbehörden dar, die
für diese beiden Anforderungen standardisierte Verfahren festlegt.
Es wird darauf hingewiesen, dass Fluchtwegeberechnungen nicht alle Einflüsse der Realität berück-
sichtigen können. Psychologische Aspekte, die zum Beispiel die Routenwahl und das Verhalten der
Person beeinflussen sind bisher noch nicht wissenschaftlich fundiert untersucht worden und können
nur durch statistische Verhaltensweisen implementiert werden. Da jedoch das Verhalten in der Reali-
tät durch den Einfluss von psychologischen Aspekten stark und unvorhersehbar variieren kann, kön-
nen solche Effekte in der Simulation nur bedingt berücksichtigt werden. Somit stellt die Simulation
einen idealisierten Fall dar, bei dem sich die Personen gemäß der Parameter und Routenvorgaben
des Benutzers bewegen.
Bemerkung: Zahlenwerte in [ ] sind angenommene Werte und sollen durch genauere ersetzt werden,
sobald welche zu Verfügung stehen.},
