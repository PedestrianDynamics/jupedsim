With  the `inifile` the simulation with `jpscore` can be controlled.

The typical structure of an `inifile` is as follows:

```xml
<jupedsim>
  <header>
       <!-- seed , geometry, output format -->
  </header>

  <traffic_constraints>
      <!-- traffic information: e.g closed doors or smoked rooms -->
  </traffic_constraints>

  <goals>
  <!-- goals (closed polygons) outside the geometry-->
  </goals>

  <agents>
      <agents_distribution>
          <!--persons information and distribution -->
      </agents_distribution>
  </agents>

  <operational_models>
      <model id="n" description="name">
          <!-- parameters of model (<n>, "name")  -->
      </model>
      <!-- other models can be defined -->
  </operational_models>

  <route_choice_models>
      <router router_id="n" description="name">
          <!-- parameters of router (<n>, "name")  -->
      </router>
      <!-- other routers can be defined -->
  </route_choice_models>

</JuPedSim>
```

### Header

The header comprises the following elements:

-   `<seed>s</seed>`

    Set the  `seed` value of the random number generator to `s`. If missing the
    current time (`time(NULL)`), is used i.e. random initial conditions.

-   `<max_sim_time>t</max_sim_time>`
    the maximal simulation time in seconds.

-   `<num_threads>n</num_threads>` the number of used cores.

-   `<show_statistics>true</show_statistics>` Show different aggregate statistics e.g. the usage of the doors. (default: false)

-   `<logfile>log.txt</logfile>` save relevant information about the simulation to a log file.
  Useful to keep track of warnings or errors that may rise during a simulation.

- `<progressbar/>`: show a progress bar of the simulation.

-  The trajectory file

```bash
 <trajectories format="xml-plain" fps="8" color_mode="velocity">
    <file location="trajectories.xml" />   </trajectories>
```

The options for the format are

-   `xml-plain`: the default xml format. It can lead to large files. See section [xml-plain](2016-11-03-trajectory#xml).

-   `plain`: simple text format. See section [plain](2016-11-03-trajectory#txt).
    - `optional_output`: possibility to give additional output. Set any of these values to `TRUE` to get the accoriding value.
        - `speed`: speed of the pedestrian
        - `velocity`: x,y components of the pedestrians's velocity
        - `final_goal`: id of the final goal the pedestrian is heading to
        - `intermediate_goal`: id of the current goal the pedestrian is heading to (usually a door)
        - `desired_direction`: x,y components of the pedestrians's desired directions
        - `group`: group of the pedestrian
        - `router`: router used by the pedestrian (id accoriding to ini-file)
        - `spotlight`: pedestrian is highlighted.
        
- The value `fps` defines the frame rate per second for the trajectories.

    - `color_mode`: coloring agents in the trajectories. Options are:
       - `velocity` (default): color is proportional to speed (slow --> red).
       - `spotlight`
       - `group`: color by group
       - `knowledge`
       - `router`
       - `final_goal`
       - `intermediate_goal`

    - `file location` defines the location of the trajectories.
       All paths are relative to the location of the project file.

-   `<geometry>geometry.xml</geometry>`
    The name and location of the geometry file. All file locations are relative
    to the actual location of the project file. See [specification](2016-11-02-geometry.html) of the geometry format.

### Traffic constraints

This section defines constraints related to the traffic.
At the moment the state of the doors can be changed (`open` or `close`)


```xml
 <traffic_constraints>
    <!-- doors states are: close or open -->
    <doors>
        <door trans_id="4" caption="Main-gate" state="open" />
        <door trans_id="6" caption="Rear-gate" state="close" />
        <file>traffic.xml</file>
    </doors>
 </traffic_constraints>
```

- `trans_id`: unique id of that specific door as defined in the geometry file. See [geometry](2016-11-02-geometry.html).

- `caption`: optional parameter defining the caption of the door.

- `state` defines the state of the door. Options are `close` or `open`.
- `file` file containing further constraints. See [traffic.xml](2019-04-12-traffic.html)

### Goals

Additional goals might be defined **outside** the geometry.
They should _NOT_ overlap with any walls or be inside rooms.
It is recommended to position them near the exits.

Goals are defined with close polygons, with  *the last vertex is equal to the first one*.

```xml
 <routing>
    <goals>
        <goal id="0" final="false" caption="goal 1">
            <polygon>
                <vertex px="-5.0" py="-5.0" />
                <vertex px="-5.0" py="-2.0" />
                <vertex px="-3.0" py="-2.0" />
                <vertex px="-3.0" py="-5.0" />
                <vertex px="-5.0" py="-5.0" />
                </polygon>
        </goal>
        <file>goals.xml</file>
    </goals>
 </routing>
```

- `file` file containing further goals. See [goals.xml](2019-04-12-goals.html)


### Agents

There are two ways to distribute agents for  a simulation:

- [random distribution](#agents_distribution) in a specific area *before* the simulation starts.
- distribution by means of [sources](#sources) *during* the simulation.

#### Agents_distribution
An example how to define agent's characteristics with different number of
attributes is as follows

```xml
 <agents>
   <agents_distribution>
     <group group_id="1" room_id="0" number="10" />

     <group group_id="2" room_id="0" subroom_id="0" number="10"
           goal_id="" router_id="1" />

   </agents_distribution>
 </agents>
```

- `group_id`: mandatory parameter defining the unique id of that group.

- `number`: mandatory parameter defining the number of agents to distribute.

- `room_id`: mandatory parameter defining the room where the agents should be
randomly distributed.

- `subroom_id`: defines the id of the subroom where the agents should be distributed.
  If omitted then the agents are homogeneously distributed in the room.

- `goal_id`: should be one of the `id`s defined in the section  [goals](#goals).
   If omitted or is `-1` then the shortest exit to the outside is chosen by the agent.

- `router_id`: defines the route choice model to be used. See [documentation](2016-11-03-routing.html) of available routers.

- `age`: not yet used by the [operational](2016-11-01-operativ.html) models.

- `gender`: not yet used.

- `height`: not yet used.

- `patience`:  this parameter influences the route choice behavior when using the quickest path router.
  It basically defines how long a pedestrian stays in jams before attempting a rerouting.

- `pre_movement_mean` and `pre_movement_sigma`: premovement time is Gauss-distributed $$\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$.

- Risk tolerance can be Gauss-distributed, or beta-distributed.
  If not specified then it is defined as $$\mathcal{N}(1, 0)$$:

  - `risk_tolerance_mean` and `risk_tolerance_sigma`: $$\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$.

  - `risk_tolerance_alpha` and `risk_tolerance_beta`: $$Beta(\alpha, \beta)$$.

- `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min` and `y_max`: define a bounding box where agents should be distributed.

- `startX`, `startY`: define the initial coordinate of the agents. This might be useful for testing/debugging.
Note that these two options are only considered if `number=1`.

- `agent_parameter_id`: choose a set of parameters for the [operational models](2016-11-01-operativ.html).

#### Sources
Besides distributing agents randomly before the simulation starts, it is
possible to define sources in order to "inject"
new agents in the system during the simulation.

```xml
 <agents_sources>
   <source id="1" frequency="2" agents_max="10" group_id="1" caption="caption" greedy="true"/>
   <source id="2" time="10" agent_id="50" group_id="1" caption="caption" greedy="true"/>
   <source id="10" caption="new-source" time_min="5" time_max="30" frequency="5" N_create="10" agents_max="300"
   group_id="0"  x_min="0" x_max="3" y_min="0" y_max="3" percent="0.5" rate="2"  greedy="true"/>
   <file>sources.xml</file>
 </agents_sources>
```

- `id`: id of the source
- `frequency`: number of pedestrians per second.
- `N_create`: How many agents to create at once (default = 1).
- `percent`: percent of `N_create` to generate
- `rate`: rate of generate of agents
- `time_min`, `time_max`: Time lifespan of the source
- `agents_max`: maximal number of agents produced by that source.
- `group_id`: group id of the agents. This `id` **should match** a predefined group in the section [Agents_distribution](#agents_distribution).
- `caption`: caption
- `greedy` (default `false`): returns a Voronoi vertex randomly with respect to weights proportional to squared distances.
   For vertexes $$v_i$$ and distances $$d_i$$ to their surrounding seeds
   calculate the probabilities $$p_i$$ as

   $$p_i= \frac{d_i^2}{\sum_j^n d_j^2}.$$

   If this attribute is set to `true`, the greedy approach is used.
   That means new agents will be placed on the vertex with the biggest distance to the surrounding seeds.

- `time`: time of appearance of agent with id `agent_id`. Here `agents_max=1`.
- `startX`, `startY`: Distribute one pedestrians at a fix position.
- `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min`, `y_max`: Bounding box for generation od agents
- `file`: a file containing further sources. See [sources.xml](2019-04-12-sources.html)

Example of usage:

- Busses are coming every 10 min (600 seconds).
- Every bus transports 100 pedestrians
- When the bus stops, every 2 seconds 10 pedestrians leave the bus
- 3 Buses at max.

```xml
 <source id="10" frequency="600" N_create="100" agents_max="300"
   percent="0.1" rate="2"  greedy="true"/>
```


## Operational models
One of the available [operational models](2016-11-01-operativ.html) should be defined.

## Router
One of the available [routers](2016-11-03-routing.html) should be defined.
