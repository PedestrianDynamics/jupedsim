With  the `inifile` the simulation with `jpscore` can be controlled. 

The typical structure of an `inifile` is as follows:

```xml
<jupedsim>
  <header> 
       <!-- seed , geometry, output format -->
  </header>        

  <traffic_constraints> 
      <!-- traffic information: e.g closed doors or smoked rooms -->
  </traffic_constraints>

  <goals>
  <!-- goals (closed polygons) outside the geometry-->
  </goals>

  <agents>
      <agents_distribution>
          <!--persons information and distribution --> 
      </agents_distribution>
  </agents>

  <operational_models>
      <model id="n" description="name">
          <!-- parameters of model (<n>, "name")  -->
      </model>
      <!-- other models can be defined -->
  </operational_models>

  <route_choice_models>
      <router router_id="n" description="name">
          <!-- parameters of router (<n>, "name")  -->
      </router>
      <!-- other routers can be defined -->
  </route_choice_models>

</JuPedSim>
```

### Header

The header comprises the following elements:

-   `<seed>s</seed>` 

    Set the  `seed` value of the random number generator to `s`. If missing the
    current time (`time(NULL)`), is used i.e. random initial conditions.

-   `<max_sim_time>t</max_sim_time>`
    the maximal simulation time in seconds. 

-   `<num_threads>n</num_threads>` the number of used cores.

-   `<show_statistics>true</show_statistics>` Show different aggregate statistics e.g. the usage of the doors. (default: false) 

-   `<logfile>log.txt</logfile>` save relevant information about the simulation to a log file. 
  Useful to keep track of warnings or errors that may rise during a simulation.

- `<progressbar/>`: show a progress bar of the simulation.

-  The trajectory file   

```bash 
 <trajectories format="xml-plain" fps="8" color_mode="velocity">  
    <file location="trajectories.xml" />   </trajectories> 
```
    
The options for the format are

-   `xml-plain`: the default xml format. It can lead to large files. See section [xml-plain](2016-11-03-trajectory#xml).

-   `plain`: simple text format. See section [plain](2016-11-03-trajectory#txt).

- The value `fps` defines the frame rate per second for the trajectories. 
  
    - `color_mode`: coloring agents in the trajectories. Options are:   
       - `velocity` (default): color is proportional to speed (slow --> red). 
       - `spotlight`
       - `group`: color by group
       - `knowledge` 
       - `router`
       - `final_goal`
       - `intermediate_goal`
       
    - `file location` defines the location of the trajectories. 
       All paths are relative to the location of the project file.

-   `<geometry>geometry.xml</geometry>`
    The name and location of the geometry file. All file locations are relative
    to the actual location of the project file. See [specification](2016-11-02-geometry.html) of the geometry format.

### Traffic constraints

This section defines constraints related to the traffic. 
At the moment the state of the doors can be changed (`open` or `close`)


```xml
 <traffic_constraints> 
    <!-- doors states are: close or open -->
    <doors>
        <door trans_id="4" caption="Main-gate" state="open" />
        <door trans_id="6" caption="Rear-gate" state="close" />
    </doors>
 </traffic_constraints>
```

- `trans_id`: unique id of that specific door as defined in the geometry file. See [geometry](2016-11-02-geometry.html).

- `caption`: optional parameter defining the caption of the door.

- `state` defines the state of the door. Options are `close` or `open`.

### Goals 

Additional goals might be defined **outside** the geometry. 
They should _NOT_ overlap with any walls or be inside rooms. 
It is recommended to position them near the exits. 

Goals are defined with close polygons, with  *the last vertex is equal to the first one*.

```xml
 <routing>
    <goals>
        <goal id="0" final="false" caption="goal 1">
            <polygon>
                <vertex px="-5.0" py="-5.0" />
                <vertex px="-5.0" py="-2.0" />
                <vertex px="-3.0" py="-2.0" />
                <vertex px="-3.0" py="-5.0" />
                <vertex px="-5.0" py="-5.0" />
                </polygon>
        </goal>
        <goal id="1" final="false" caption="goal 2">
            <polygon>
                <vertex px="15.0" py="-5.0" />
                <vertex px="17.0" py="-5.0" />
                <vertex px="17.0" py="-7.0" />
                <vertex px="15.0" py="-7.0" />
                <vertex px="15.0" py="-5.0" />
            </polygon>
        </goal>
    </goals>
 </routing>
```    


### Agents

There are two ways to distribute agents for  a simulation:

- [random distribution](#agents_distribution) in a specific area *before* the simulation starts. 
- distribution by means of [sources](#sources) *during* the simulation.

#### Agents_distribution
An example how to define agent's characteristics with different number of
attributes is as follows

```xml
 <agents>
   <agents_distribution>
     <group group_id="1" room_id="0" number="10" />
     
     <group group_id="2" room_id="0" subroom_id="0" number="10" 
           goal_id="" router_id="1" />
           
   </agents_distribution>
 </agents>
```

- `group_id`: mandatory parameter defining the unique id of that group.

- `number`: mandatory parameter defining the number of agents to distribute.

- `room_id`: mandatory parameter defining the room where the agents should be
randomly distributed.

- `subroom_id`: defines the id of the subroom where the agents should be distributed. 
  If omitted then the agents are homogeneously distributed in the room. 

- `goal_id`: should be one of the `id`s defined in the section  [goals](#goals). 
   If omitted or is `-1` then the shortest exit to the outside is chosen by the agent.

- `router_id`: defines the route choice model to be used. See [documentation](2016-11-03-routing.html) of available routers.

- `age`: not yet used by the [operational](2016-11-01-operativ.html) models.

- `gender`: not yet used.

- `height`: not yet used.

- `patience`:  this parameter influences the route choice behavior when using the quickest path router. 
  It basically defines how long a pedestrian stays in jams before attempting a rerouting.

- `pre_movement_mean` and `pre_movement_sigma`: premovement time is Gauss-distributed $$\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$.

- Risk tolerance can be Gauss-distributed, or beta-distributed. 
  If not specified then it is defined as $$\mathcal{N}(1, 0)$$:

  - `risk_tolerance_mean` and `risk_tolerance_sigma`: $$\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$$.

  - `risk_tolerance_alpha` and `risk_tolerance_beta`: $$Beta(\alpha, \beta)$$.

- `x_min`, `x_max`, `y_min` and `y_max`: define a bounding box where agents should be distributed.

- `startX`, `startY`: define the initial coordinate of the agents. This might be useful for testing/debugging. 
Note that these two options are only considered if `number=1`.

- `agent_parameter_id`: choose a set of parameters for the [operational models](2016-11-01-operativ.html).

#### Sources 
Besides distributing agents randomly before the simulation starts, it is
possible to define sources in order to "inject" 
new agents in the system during the simulation.

```xml
 <agents_sources>
 <source id="1" frequency="2" agents_max="10" group_id="1" caption="caption" greedy="true"/>
 <source id="2" time="10" agent_id="50" group_id="1" caption="caption" greedy="true"/>
 </agents_sources>
```

- `id`: id of the source
- `frequency`: number of pedestrians per second.
- `agents_max`: maximal number of agents produced by that source.
- `group_id`: group id of the agents. This `id` should match a predefined group in the section [Agents_distribution](#agents_distribution).
- `caption`: caption
- `greedy` (default `false`): returns a Voronoi vertex randomly with respect to weights proportional to squared distances.  
   For vertexes $$v_i$$ and distances $$d_i$$ to their surrounding seeds
   calculate the probabilities $$p_i$$ as  
   
   $$p_i= \frac{d_i^2}{\sum_j^n d_j^2}.$$
   
   If this attribute is set to `true`, the greedy approach is used. 
   That means new agents will be placed on the vertex with the biggest distance to the surrounding seeds.
 
- `time`: time of appearance of agent with id `agent_id`. Here `agents_max=1`.

## Operational models
One of the available [operational models](2016-11-01-operativ.html) should be defined.

## Router
One of the available [routers](2016-11-03-routing.html) should be defined.
