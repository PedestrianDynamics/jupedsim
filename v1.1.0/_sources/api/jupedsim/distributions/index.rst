   Generates specified number of randomized 2D coordiantes.

   This function will generate the speficied number of 2D coordiantes where
   all coordiantes are inside the specified geometry and generated coordinates
   are constraint by distance_to_agents and distance_to_polygon. This function
   may not always by able to generate the requested coordinate because it
   cannot do so without violating the constraints. In this case the function
   will stop after max_iterations and raise an Exception.

   Generates randomized 2D coordinates based on a desired agent density per
   square meter.

   This function will generate as many 2D coordinates as required to reach the
   desired density. Essentially this function tries to place area * density
   many agents while adhering to the distance_to_polygon and
   distance_to_agents constraints. This function may not always by able to
   generate the requested coordinate because it cannot do so without violating
   the constraints. In this case the function will stop after max_iterations
   and raise an Exception.

   Generates randomized 2D coordiantes in a user defined number of rings.

   This function will generate 2D coordinates in the intersection of the
   polygon and the rings specified by the centerpoint and the min/max radii of
   each ring. `number_of_agents` is expected to contain the number of agents
   to be placed for each ring. This function may not always by able to
   generate the requested coordinate because it cannot do so without violating
   the constraints. In this case the function will stop after max_iterations
   and raise an Exception.

   Generates randomized 2D coordiantes in a user defined number of rings
   with defined density.

   This function will generate 2D coordinates in the intersection of the
   polygon and the rings specified by the centerpoint and the min/max radii of
   each ring. The number of positions generated is defined by the desired
   density and available space of each ring. This function may not always by
