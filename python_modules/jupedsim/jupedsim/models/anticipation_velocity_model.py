class AnticipationVelocityModel:
    """Anticipation Velocity Model (AVM).

    The AVM incorporates pedestrian anticipation, divided into three phases:
    1. Perception of the current situation.
    2. Prediction of future situations.
    3. Strategy selection leading to action.

    This model quantitatively reproduces bidirectional pedestrian flow by accounting for:
    - Anticipation of changes in neighboring pedestrians' positions.
    - The strategy of following others' movement. The AVM is a model that takes into consideration
      the anticipation of pedestrians. For this, the process of anticipation is divided into three parts:
      - perception of the actual situation,
      - prediction of a future situation and
      - selection of a strategy leading to action.


    A general description of the AVM can be found in the originating publication
    https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103464

    Attributes:
        pushout_strength: The pushout mechanism ensures agents maintain a safe distance
        from walls by adding a small outward component to their movement when within the
        critical wall distance. This outward component, scaled by `pushoutStrength`,
        combines with the parallel component of the agent's direction to create smooth,
        gliding behavior along walls.
        rng_seed: seed value of internally used rng. If not explicitly set this
            value will be chosen randomly.

    .. note::

        Instances of this type are copied when creating the agent, you can safely
        create one instance of this type and modify it between calls to `add_agent`

        E.g.:

        .. code:: python

            positions = [...] # List of initial agent positions
            params = AnticipationVelocityModelAgentParameters(v0=0.9) # all agents are slower
            for p in positions:
                params.position = p
                sim.add_agent(params)

    Attributes:
        position: Position of the agent.
        time_gap: Time constant that describe how fast pedestrian close gaps.
        v0: Maximum speed of the agent.
        radius: Radius of the agent.
        journey_id: Id of the journey the agent follows.
        stage_id: Id of the stage the agent targets.
        strength_neighbor_repulsion: Strength of the repulsion from neighbors
        range_neighbor_repulsion: Range of the repulsion from neighbors
        wall_buffer_distance: Buffer distance of agents to the walls.
        anticipation_time: Anticipation time of an agent.
        reaction_time: reaction time of an agent to change its direction.
