 * \section Description
 * Implementation of classes for a reworked floorfield. A floorfield in general
 * yields a cost field to a specific goal and a correlated vectorfield for the
 * optimal path in terms of the cost value.
 *
 * Rework focused on a cleaner structure and less inheritance (no diamond) and
 * less workarounds.
