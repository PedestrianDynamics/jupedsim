# Agent Creation

Right now Agent creation is an integral part of the simulation, i.e. agent
placement is computed by the simulation.

In the future however every agent created shall be precomputed and stored
upfront as an event to improve reproducibility. All code that deals with the
current implementation of agent creation is contained here in this folder.
