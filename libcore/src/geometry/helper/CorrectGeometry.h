/**
 * \ingroup
 * Correct geometries by deleting "big" walls
 * In a subroom, "big" refers to a wall that intersects with other walls in the same subroom in a point,
 * which does not coincide with one of the end points.
 * For example:
 *
 *```
 *                            C
 *  A x------------------------o-----------------x B
 *                ^            |
 *                wall1        |
 *                             |  <--- wall2
 *                             o
 *                             D
 *```
 *  Here wall `[AB]` is a big wall, then it intersects wall `[CD]` whether in A nor in B
 *  What happens in this method:
 *  1. `[AB]` will be splited into two segments`[AC]` and `[CB]`
 *  2. `[AB]` will be removed
 *  3. `[AC]` or `[CB]` will be added to the subroom
 *
