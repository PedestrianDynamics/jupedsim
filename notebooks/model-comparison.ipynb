    "# Comparative Analysis of Pedestrian Dynamics Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook compares four pedestrian dynamics models by simulating agent behavior in a  \n",
    "structured environment. Using simplified scenarios, we analyze how each model handles  \n",
    "navigation, obstacle avoidance, and agent interactions. This comparison reveals the strengths  \n",
    "and weaknesses of each approach, helping inform model selection when using JuPedSim.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing a pedestrian dynamics model in JuPedSim, the decision largely depends on the  \n",
    "specific scenario you want to simulate or the behavior you want to reproduce. The available  \n",
    "models can be divided into two main categories: **force-based** and **velocity-based** models,  \n",
    "each with their own strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Force-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Force-based models, which include the **Social Force Model (SFM)** and the **Generalized  \n",
    "Centrifugal Force Model (GCFM)**, excel at simulating physical interactions between pedestrians.  \n",
    "These models are particularly effective at capturing pushing behavior in dense crowds, making  \n",
    "them ideal for evacuation scenarios or situations where physical contact between pedestrians  \n",
    "is common. The **GCFM** offers some improvements over the basic **SFM**, particularly in handling  \n",
    "body shape effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Velocity-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, velocity-based models like the **Collision-Free Model (CFM)** and the  \n",
    "**Anticipation Velocity Model (AVM)** are better suited for normal walking situations where  \n",
    "collision avoidance is the primary concern. These models typically produce smoother, more  \n",
    "realistic trajectories in regular-density scenarios. The **AVM**, in particular, stands out for  \n",
    "its superior collision avoidance capabilities and ability to reproduce lane formation behavior,  \n",
    "as demonstrated in [recent research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103464).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to computational efficiency, velocity-based models generally have an advantage.  \n",
    "The **CFM** offers the fastest execution times, while the **AVM** provides a good balance between  \n",
    "computational efficiency and realistic behavior simulation. Force-based models, while more  \n",
    "computationally intensive, are necessary when accurate physical interaction modeling is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Selection Guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of model ultimately comes down to your specific requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Force-based models (SFM, GCFM):** Best for emergency evacuations or crowded environments  \n",
    "  with significant physical interactions.  \n",
    "- **Velocity-based models (AVM):** Ideal for typical pedestrian scenarios requiring smooth  \n",
    "  navigation and realistic avoidance behavior.  \n",
    "- **Collision-Free Model (CFM):** Suitable when computational resources are limited and  \n",
    "  physical interactions are not critical.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to understand that no single model is universally superior—each has its place  \n",
    "depending on the specific requirements of your simulation scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So as a final facit, which model to use? The answer is: it depends.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models Under Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebooks the models compared are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Collision-Free Speed Model (CSM):**](https://pedestriandynamics.org/models/collision_free_speed_model/)  \n",
    "   A velocity-based model focused on ensuring agents move without collisions  \n",
    "  by dynamically adjusting their speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**Anticipation Velocity Model (AVM):**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2021.103464)  \n",
    "   A model that incorporates anticipation and reaction times, allowing agents  \n",
    "  to predict and avoid potential collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [**Social Force Model (SFM):**](https://pedestriandynamics.org/models/social_force_model/)\n",
    "   A force-based model where agents are influenced   \n",
    "   by attractive forces toward goals and repulsive forces \n",
    "   from obstacles and other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [**Generalized Centrifugal Force Model (GCFM):**](https://pedestriandynamics.org/models/generalized_centrifugal_force_model/)  \n",
    "   An enhanced force-based model where agents experience centrifugal forces  \n",
    "  to better simulate realistic avoidance behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:**  \n",
    "> All models are utilized with their default parameter settings as defined in **JuPedSim**."
