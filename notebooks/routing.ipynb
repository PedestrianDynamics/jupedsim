    "\n",
    "In our simulated scenario, agents are presented with two distinct paths: a direct route that is shorter but prone to congestion and a detour. \n",
    "Given the high volume of individuals arriving at door 1, relying solely on one door's capacity proves impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the alternate path through door 2 may be considerably longer in distance, it becomes crucial to utilize both doors in order to alleviate congestion and reduce waiting times at door 1.\n",
    "The findings from our simulation align with this rationale. \n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize both average and peak arrival times, approximately 40% of individuals should choose the longer journey via door 2, which is in accordance with the results reported in this [paper](https://collective-dynamics.eu/index.php/cod/article/view/A24).\n",
    "This strategic distribution ensures smoother flow dynamics and contributes towards enhancing evacuation efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that in  we used a fixed seed number to distribute the agents. To get a reliable result  for this specific scenario, one should repeat the simulations many times for the sake of some statistical relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that in the section [Allocation and Configuration of Agents](#distribution), we employed a consistent seed number for agent distribution. For dependable outcomes, it's advised to run the simulations multiple times to ensure statistical significance. Morover, more percentage values between 0 and 100 will enhance the quality of the results."
