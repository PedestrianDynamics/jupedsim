 * \section Description
 * The local FloorfieldViaFM is derived from the FloorfieldViaFM class. It will
 * create Floorfields in a room (room consisting of one or more subrooms) for
 * each exit. It is to be used in conjunction with a router, yielding intermediate
 * goals which are a door in the same room. It uses all the calculations and the
 * working on grid form the motherclass, yet it has a different constructor.

 NOTE: both parents are derived from FloorfieldViaFM with "public virtual" (it is called "Virtual Inheritance"). This
 means that there is only one instance of FloorfieldViaFM in CentrePointLocalFFViaFM, so calls to FlorfieldViaFM's member
 variables and functions are not ambiguous. See http://www.programering.com/a/MDOxITMwATk.html for some nice diagrams.
