 * \section Description
 * The Floorfield Kit is the rework of the prototype FloorfieldViaFM - class.
 * It will restructur the former version to avoid several downsides (diamond
 * inheritance, line/centerpoint version (DRY), overdoing the precalc, ...)
 * We try to build it in a cleaner, easier version.
 *
 * A floorfield will be calculated and stored. The user can access distances(cost)
 * values as well as the gradient of that.
 *
 * Cost Values are calculated via the fastmarching algorithm. Other algorithms might
 * follow, if they provide better abilities to work in paralell.
 *
 * The new grid-code/subroom version should be reused for all floorfields, that work
 * on the same part of the geometry (room/subroom e.g. floor/room)
