\section*{Test 14 Choice of route}

The start and the target area are connected by two flights of stairs (dark grey) and a corridor on the ground floor and by a (longer) corridor on the upper floor.

\noindent
Do the pedestrians take a shorter route via another floor or do they stay on the longer route on the same floor?
